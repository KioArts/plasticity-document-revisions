# Continuity of the Curve and the Surface

The continuity of a curve or a surface refers to the smoothness and quality of the shape. The continuity is determined by the degree of matching between the position, direction, curvature, and curvature change rate of the adjacent segments.

## Curve Continuity
There are four levels of curve continuity: G0, G1, G2, and G3.
- **G0:** Two Curves are connected, but only their positions match at the connection point.
- **G1:** Two Curves are connected, and their positions and directions match at the connection point.
- **G2:** Two Curves are connected, and their positions, directions, and curvatures match at the connection point.
- **G3:** Two Curves are connected, and their positions, directions, curvatures, and curvature change rates match at the connection point.

Higher continuity is required to create smoother and more natural Curves.

## Surface Continuity
There are three levels of surface continuity: G0, G1, and G2.
- **G0:** Two surfaces are connected, but only their positions match at the connection point. 
- **G1:** Two surfaces are connected, and their positions and tangents match at the connection point. 
- **G2:** Two surfaces are connected, and their positions, tangents, and curvatures match at the connection point. 

Higher continuity is required to create smoother and more natural surfaces.
