# Project onto construction plane

You can create a curve projected onto the construction plane from a curve or edge.

<KinouGaiyou shortcut="Alt+D" command="Alternative Duplicate" button="Left of the command bar" />

1. Activate the construction plane you want to project onto.
2. Select the curve or edge you want to create as the target.
3. Press the shortcut `Alt`+`D`.
4. The move gizmo appears and you can freely move the projected curve.
   - You can also limit the direction of movement.
           - `Shift`+`Z` : **Z plane** : Constrains to the Z plane.
     - `Shift`+`X` : **X plane** : Constrains to the X plane.
     - `Shift`+`Y` : **Y plane** : Constrains to the Y plane.
     - `G` : **Screen space** : Constrains to the apparent plane.
     - `F` : **Freestyle** : Constrains the direction by two points.
     - `V` : **Pivot** : Constrains the direction by clicking on the plane.
     - `W` : **Worldspace** : Releases the directional constraint.
5. Confirm with **OK** in the command dialog or right click.
