# Project

<Reference shortcut="I" command="Project" button="Right of the command bar" />

The behavior varies depending on the selected objects when executing the command.

- When two curves are selected: [**Project Curve Curve**](#project-curve-curve)
- When two solids or sheets are selected: [**Project Body Body**](#project-body-body)
- Otherwise: [**Project Curve Body**](#project-curve-body)

## Project Curve Curve [#project-curve-curve]

You can create a curve by projecting the intersection curve of two selected curves.

1. Select the two curves to be projected.
2. Press the shortcut `I` or click the button.
3. The projected intersection curve will be created.

## Project Body Body [#project-body-body]

1. Select two solids or sheets.
2. Press the shortcut `I` or click the button.
3. A curve representing the intersection line will be created.

## Project Curve Body [#project-curve-body]

You can project a curve onto a solid or sheet to create a curve.

1. Select the solid or sheet to project onto.
2. Press the shortcut `I` or click the button.
3. Select the curve to project.
4. Set the options in the command dialog:
   - **Method**
     - **Normal**
       - Projects in the positive Z-axis direction based on the construction plane.
     - **Vector**
       - Specifies the projection direction with the **Direction** option.
         - **Direction**
           - Projects in the specified vector direction (**X**, **Y**, **Z**) based on the construction plane.
   - **Bidirectional**
     - When enabled, the projection will also occur in the negative direction of the specified axis.
   - **X-Ray**
     - When enabled, the projection will not occur on hidden faces in the positive direction of the specified axis.
5. Click OK or right-click in the command dialog to confirm.
6. The projected curve will be created.
