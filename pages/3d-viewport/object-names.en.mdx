# Object Names

## Sketch

### Curve
Line or curve consisting of Vertex and Control-Vertex.
To select, set the selection mode to "Edge".
Multiple curves can be connected and treated as one.
It is displayed as a blue line in the sketch. When you point the cursor on it, it turns white, and when selected, it turns yellow.

### Vertex
A point that exists at both ends of a curve and determines the position of the curve.
To display and select it, set the selection mode to "Control-Point".
It appears as a purple dot in the sketch. It turns white when you point the cursor on it, and stays white when you select it.
When multiple Vertexes are matched, they are indicated by a blue-green dot. Note that this only indicates a match and has nothing to do with the presence or absence of a connection.

### Control-Vertex (CV)
A point that exists in the middle of a curve and determines the shape of the curve.
To display and select it, set the selection mode to "Control-Point".
It appears as a small purple dot on the sketch. It turns white when you point the cursor on it and stays white when you select it.
Vertex and Control-Vertex are connected by a white line to make it easier to recognize their relationship to Curve.
By adding Control-Vertex, complex curves can be expressed.

### Region
Area surrounded by curves. To select, set the selection mode to "Face". It appears as a dark blue area in the sketch. When the cursor is pointed at the Region, the default command Extrude is automatically executed.

**Note**<br />
The result of the command is different when a closed curve is selected and when Region is selected. For example, when Extrude, a closed curve creates a sheet and a region creates a solid.

## Solid

### Solid
Three-dimensional sealed with Face.
To select, set the selection mode to "Body".
If you delete some Face, it becomes a Sheet.
It is displayed in gray in the 3D viewport, and the outline turns white when you point the cursor on it, and yellow when you select it.

### Sheet
An open solid surrounded by a Face.
To select it, set the selection mode to Body.
It is displayed in gray in the 3D viewport, and when the cursor is pointed at it, the outline turns white, and when selected, it turns yellow.

### Face
The planar or curved surfaces that make up Solid and Sheet.
To select, set the selection mode to Face.
It will appear gray in the 3D viewport, lighten when you point the cursor on it, and turn yellow when selected.
When Face is selected, the default command Offset Face is automatically executed.

### Edge
Face Border.
To select, set the selection mode to "Edge".
It is displayed as a black line, which turns white when the cursor is pointed at it, and turns yellow when selected.
When the edge of the boundary between two Faces is selected, the default command Fillet is automatically executed, and when the open edge of a Sheet is selected, the default command Extend Sheet is automatically executed.
