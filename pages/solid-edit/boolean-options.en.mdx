# Solid Editing Boolean options

Some commands can be executed with Boolean operations at the time of execution.

### Shortcut keys

- `Shift-Q` **Slice**
    - Creates a solid at the intersection of the boolean target and tool, keeping both the resulting solid and the remaining solid.
- `Q` **Union**
    - Joins the boolean target and tool together.
- `W` **Difference**
    - Removes the tool from the boolean target.
- `Shift-E` **Intersect**
    - Creates a solid at the intersection of the boolean target and tool.
- `B` **New Body**
    - Creates a new solid. The Boolean operation is canceled.
- `T` **Keep Tool**
    - The Boolean operation is executed, and a new solid is also created.
