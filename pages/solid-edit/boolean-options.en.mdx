# Boolean options

Boolean operations can be performed using keyboard shortcuts for certain commands.

### Shortcut

- `Shift-Q` **Slice**
    - A solid is created at the intersections with the Boolean target, and the remaining solids are also preserved.
- `Q` **Union**
    - Joins the boolean target and tool together.
- `W` **Difference**
    - Removes the tool from the boolean target.
- `Shift-E` **Intersect**
    - Creates a solid at the intersection of the boolean target and tool.
- `B` **New Body**
    - Creates a new solid. Boolean operations are not performed.
- `T` **Keep Tool**
    - Boolean operations are performed, but the tool objects remain intact.
