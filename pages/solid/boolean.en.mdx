# Boolean

<Reference shortcut="Q" command="Boolean" button="In Command Bar"  buttonIcon="button-boolean"/>

Combine, subtract, or intersect multiple objects in any combination of Solids and Sheets.

## Basic Usage

1. Press <kbd>Q</kbd> to excute the command.
2. Select the target and the tool.
   - <Kst>Command Dialog</Kst>
         - **Select target bodies:** 
         - When this button is highlighted, you can select the Solid or Sheet to be used as the Boolean target.
         - To change the target, click this button again and select the Solid or Sheet.
      - **Select tool bodies:** 
         - When this button is highlighted, you can select the Solid or Sheet to be used as the Boolean tool.
         - To change the tool, click this button again and select the Solid or Sheet.
3. Set the options in the Command Dialog and Keyboard Shortcuts.
   - <Kst>Command Dialog</Kst>
      - **Keep Tools:** Performs Boolean operations while keeping the tool objects intact.
      - **Opetation:**
         - **Union:** Joins the Boolean target and tool together.
         - **Difference:** Removes the tool from the Boolean target.
         - **Intersect:** Creates a Solid at the intersection of the Boolean target and tool.
         - **Slice:** Creates a Solid at the intersections with the Boolean target and preserves the remaining Solids.
         - **Region:** Creates solids from enclosed regions formed within the collection of bodies (Solids and Sheets).
         - For differences in results based on the operation, please refer to the [Operation Outcome Differences](#operation-outcome-differences) section.
      - **Advanced:**
         - **Target Material:** Defines how the target object is executed during the Boolean operation either as a solid or a sheet. This setting influences how the tool object interacts with the target object, especially in operations like Difference and Intersection.
            - **Default:** Uses the default state of the body.
            - **Empty:** Treats the body as an empty shell.
            - **Inside:** Treats the body as a solid object from the inside based on the normal direction of Tool object.
            - **Outside:** Treats the body as a solid object from the outside based on the normal direction of Tool object.
         - **Tool Material:** Controls how the tool object behaves in the Boolean operation. You can choose to treat it as a solid or a sheet, affecting how it interacts with parts of the target.
            - **Default:** Uses the default state of the body.
            - **Empty:** Treats the body as an empty shell.
            - **Inside:** Treats the body as a solid object from the inside based on the normal direction of Target object.
            - **Outside:** Treats the body as a solid object from the outside based on the normal direction of Target object.
         - For differences in results based on the operation, please refer to the [Advanced Boolean Operation Differences](#advanced-boolean-operations-differences) section.

## Operation Outcome Differences [#operation-outcome-differences]

### Normal Boolean Operations [#normal-boolean-operations]

   #### Target: Solid, Tool: Solid
   ![Boolean 1](/img/boolean-1.png)

   #### Target: Solid, Tool: Sheet
   ![Boolean 2](/img/boolean-2.png)

   #### Target: Sheet, Tool: Solid
   ![Boolean 3](/img/boolean-3.png)

   #### Target: Sheet, Tool: Sheet
   ![Boolean 4](/img/boolean-4.png)

### Advanced Boolean Operation Differences [#advanced-boolean-operations-differences]

   #### Target: Solid, Tool: Solid
   ![Boolean 1](/img/boolean-5.png)

   > **Note:** **Target:Outside / Tool:Empty** - Slicing the target and tool objects produces three results: a combined duplicate of both objects, a sheet from the tool with the intersecting area removed and a solid from the target with the intersecting area removed.
