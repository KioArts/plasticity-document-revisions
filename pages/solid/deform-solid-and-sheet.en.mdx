# Deform Solid and Sheet

<Reference shortcut="" command="Deform" button="" />

Wrap existing solid and sheet objects onto a regular and irregular surface.

## Basic Usage

1. Select the objects you want to wrap.
2. Type **Deform** in the Command Palette.
3. Select a reference face as a neutral plane.
4. Select the target face to deform objects with.
5. Set the options in the Command Dialog.
    - <Kst>Command Dialog</Kst>
          - **Scale:** Scale in **U, V, N** Value.  
          - **Offset:** Offset in **U, V, N** Value.
          - **Flip:** 
                - **Mirror:** Mirror horizontally the deformed objects relative to the surface. 
                - **UV:** Flip the U and V orientation of the deformed objects.
                - **Normal:** Flip the normal of the deformed objects.
          - **Reblend:** Reblend the deformed objects. Recalculates the fillets of your objects and translates them again, removing any unwanted deformations.
          - **Keep Tools:** Performs Deform operation while keeping the tool objects intact.
6. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.

**Note**

Scale and Offset uses a **UVN** coordinate system instead of **XYZ** coordinate system when adjsuting the parametric value, allowing you to define the orientation of the deformed objects at a specific point in relation to the target surface. For more information on the UVN coordiante system, click [here](/cad-essentials/uvn-coordinate-system).

**Tip**

To avoid unwanted deformation or inaccurate placement, use the **Unwrap Face** command from the Command Palette on the target object. This generates a correctly mapped surface, which can then be used as an accurate reference face.
