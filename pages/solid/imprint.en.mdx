# Imprint

This command automatically calls the following command depending on the selected object.
     - When Curves or Solid or Sheet are selected or nothing is selected: see [**Imprint Curve Body**](#imprint-curve-body) described below.
     - When two Solids or/and Sheets are selected: see [**Imprint Body Body**](#imprint-body-body) described below.

## Imprint Curve Body[#imprint-curve-body]

You can project a curves onto a solid or sheet to create an edges.

### When Curves are selected:

1. Press <kbd>Shift + I</kbd>.
2. Select Solid or Sheet to project the Curves onto.
3. Proceed to step 4.

### When Solid or Sheet are selected:

1. Press <kbd>Shift + I</kbd>.
2. Select Curves to project onto the Solid or Sheet.
3. Proceed to step 4.

### When nothing is selected:

1. Press <kbd>Shift + I</kbd>.
2. Select Solid or Sheet to project the Curves onto.
3. Select Curves to project onto the Solid or Sheet.
4. Set the options in the Command Dialog and Keyboard Shortcuts.
   - **Method:**
        - **Normal:** Projects using the standard method.
        - **Vector:** Projects in the direction specified by **Direction**. **Bidirectional** and **X-Ray** will be enabled.
   - **Direction:**
        - **Value 1:** Specify the X component of the vector for the projection direction.
        - **Value 2:** Specify the Y component of the vector for the projection direction.
        - **Value 3:** Specify the Z component of the vector for the projection direction.
   - **Bidirectional:** Performs the projection in both directions.
   - **X-Ray:** 
        - **Hide occlusion:** When enabled, does not project onto surfaces behind the object.
   - **Completion:** Specify the extension of the projected edges.
        - **None:** Does not extend the projected edges.
        - **Edge:** Extends the projected edges until they intersect with other edges.
        - **Boundary:** Extends the projected edges until they intersect with other edges and connects them.
5. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.

## Imprint Body Body[#imprint-body-body]

You can create an edge at the intersection of two solids or/and sheets.

1. Select the first solid or sheet that you want to use as the target for the intersection.
2. Select the second solid or sheet that you want to use as the tool for the intersection.
3. Set the options in the Command Dialog.
   - **Imprint tool:** Turn on **Imprint** to specify the **Complete tool** option.
   - **Complete target:** 
        - **None:** Does not extend the projected edges on the target body.
        - **Edge:** Extends the projected edges until they intersect with other edges on the target body.
   - **Complete tool:**
        - **None:** Does not extend the projected edges on the tool body.
        - **Edge:** Extends the projected edges until they intersect with other edges on the tool body.   
4. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.
