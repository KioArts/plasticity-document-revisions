# Measure Curvature

<Reference shortcut="" command="Measure Curvature" button="" />

Measure the curvature of surface edges, curves, and isoparms using a curvature comb (displayed in white) to visually evaluate shape quality and smoothness.

  <summary>What is Curvature Evaluation?</summary>
  <div className="px-4">
    <p className="mt-2 space-y-4">
      The <strong>Measure Curvature</strong> tool analyzes the curvature of curves or surfaces to help you evaluate smoothness and continuity.
      It displays curvature combs that represent the curvature radius at different points, which is especially helpful for ensuring high-quality surfaces.

  <summary>Evaluating Surface Continuity</summary>
  <p className="mt-2">
    Use the tool to assess whether the surface or curve has G0, G1, G2 and G3 continuity connection across. 
    <ul>
    - G0 (Position Continuity) - The surfaces and curves meet at the same point, but there may be a visible angle or break. 
    - G1 (Tangent Continuity) - The surfaces and curves not only meet, but their tangents (direction of flow) align.  
    - G2 (Curvature Continuity) - The curvature (rate of change of the tangent) matches across the connection. This results in a very smooth, flowing transition with no visual or reflective break.  
    - G3 (Acceleration Continuity) -  Also known as "rate of curvature continuity", G3 ensures that the change in curvature is smooth across the junction. This eliminates even subtle reflection breaks. 
    </ul>

  <summary>Understanding Curvature Combs</summary>
  <p>
  The curvature comb plots are interpreted by the change in line lenght as you look along the curve from start to end.

    1. A constant lenght of comb indicates a constant radius, for example an erc.
    2. A changing comb length indicates acceleration or deceleration of the curve shape.
    3. Inflections are shown by the combs switching sides and optionally by an additional red arrow indicator.
    4. Breaks in the red boundary curves indicate curvature discrepancies across edit points or between two curves.

2. Type **"Measure Curvature"** in the Command Palette.
3. Set the options in the Command Dialog.
   - <Kst>Command Dialog</Kst>
         - **Scale:** Adjusts visual size of combs.
4. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.

**Info**    
Curvature evaluation helps you:
    - **Ensure surface quality:** Identify and eliminate ripples, dents, or unintended kinks to maintain smooth transitions.
    - **Verify continuity:** Assess whether surfaces meet with G0 (position), G1 (tangent), or G2 (curvature) continuity.
    - **Refine reflection flow:** Essential in automotive and industrial design, where surfaces must appear seamless under various lighting conditions.
    - **Predict manufacturability:** Sharp or abrupt curvature changes can pose challenges in machining, molding, or fabrication.
