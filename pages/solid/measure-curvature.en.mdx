# Measure Curvature

<Reference shortcut="" command="Measure Curvature" button="" />

Measure the curvature of surface edges, curves, and isoparms using a curvature comb (displayed in white) to visually evaluate shape quality and smoothness.

## Basic Usage

1. Select two adjacent and touching surface edges.
2. Type **"Measure Continuity"** in the Command Palette.
3. Set the options in the Command Dialog.
   - <Kst>Command Dialog</Kst>
         - **Continuity:** Verifies the type of edge continuity:
            - **G0:** Checks for position continuity. Measures the positional deviation in metric units based on your current unit settings in Plasticity.
            - **G1:** Checks for tangency continuity. Measures the angular deviation in degrees between adjacent surfaces.
            - **G2:** Checks for curvature continuity by comparing curvature values between adjacent surfaces.
        - **G0 Scale / G1 Scale / G2 Scale:** 
                - Adjusts visual size of combs or deviation plot
        - **G0 Tolerance/ G1 Tolerance/ G2 Tolerance:** 
                - Adjusts the numerical threshold for deviation detection.
   - <Kst>Keyboard Shortcuts</Kst>
      - <kbd>Tab</kbd> **Cycle:** Cycle through continuity options.
4. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.

**Info**
Curvature evaluation helps you:
    - **Ensure surface quality:** Identify and eliminate ripples, dents, or unintended kinks to maintain smooth transitions.
    - **Verify continuity:** Assess whether surfaces meet with G0 (position), G1 (tangent), or G2 (curvature) continuity.
    - **Refine reflection flow:** Essential in automotive and industrial design, where surfaces must appear seamless under various lighting conditions.
    - **Predict manufacturability:** Sharp or abrupt curvature changes can pose challenges in machining, molding, or fabrication.
