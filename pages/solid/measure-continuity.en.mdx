# Measure Continuity

<Reference shortcut="" command="Measure Continuity" button="" />

Measure the continuity of surface edges by evaluating whether the connection is G0, G1, or G2 (G3 is not supported).

## Basic Usage

1. Select two adjacent and touching surface edges.
2. Type **"Measure Continuity"** in the Command Palette.
3. Set the options in the Command Dialog.
   - <Kst>Command Dialog</Kst>
         - **Continuity:** Verifies the type of edge continuity:
            - **G0:** Checks for position continuity. Measures the positional deviation in metric units based on your current unit settings in Plasticity.
            - **G1:** Checks for tangency continuity. Measures the angular deviation in degrees between adjacent surfaces.
            - **G2:** Checks for curvature continuity by comparing curvature deviation and displays percentage values (0.0 - 1.0) values between adjacent surfaces.
        - **G0 Scale / G1 Scale / G2 Scale:** 
                - Adjusts visual size of combs and deviation plot.
        - **G0 Tolerance/ G1 Tolerance/ G2 Tolerance:** 
                - Adjusts the numerical threshold for deviation detection.

      - <kbd>Tab</kbd> **Cycle:** Cycle through continuity options.
4. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.

## Continuity Markers

The continuity marker icons provide a quick summary of how well two adjoining surfaces satisfy the selected continuity level:

- **G0 (position)** - points meet.
- **G1 (tangent)** - tangents align.
- **G2 (curvature)** - curvature values match.

Each icon indicates whether the measured deviation is within tolerance, falls into a defined exception case, or fails the required continuity condition.

| Icon | Meaning |
| :---: | --- |
| <ButtonIcon type="button-green-check"/> | **Within tolerance**. The surfaces meet the selected continuity level (G0, G1, or G2), and the measured deviation is inside the allowed range. |
| <ButtonIcon type="button-yellow-check"/> | **Special case for G2 curvature continuity**. A deviation value of **1.0** is reported as **“flat”**, meaning one surface has an infinite radius of curvature in a given direction. This is treated as an **exception**, not an error. Because this lies between tolerance limits, visual inspection with shaders is recommended. |
| <ButtonIcon type="button-yellow-warning"/> | **Continuity mismatch across levels**. The current continuity level meets tolerance, but a lower continuity order requirement does not. For example, G1 may be within tolerance while G0 fails, so the overall connection is not considered successful. |
| <ButtonIcon type="button-red-cross"/> | **Out of tolerance**. The surfaces cannot meet the selected continuity level within the allowed deviation range. |
