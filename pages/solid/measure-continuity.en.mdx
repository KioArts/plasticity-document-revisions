# Measure Continuity

<Reference shortcut="" command="Measure Continuity" button="" />

Measure the continuity of surface edges by evaluating whether the connection is G0, G1, or G2 (G3 is not supported).

## Basic Usage

1. Select two adjacent and touching surface edges.
2. Type **"Measure Continuity"** in the Command Palette.
3. Set the options in the Command Dialog.
   - <Kst>Command Dialog</Kst>
         - **Continuity:** Verifies the type of edge continuity:
            - **G0:** Checks for position continuity. Measures the positional deviation in metric units based on your current unit settings in Plasticity.
            - **G1:** Checks for tangency continuity. Measures the angular deviation in degrees between adjacent surfaces.
            - **G2:** Checks for curvature continuity by comparing curvature values between adjacent surfaces.
        - **G0 Scale / G1 Scale / G2 Scale:** 
                - Adjusts visual size of combs and deviation plot.
        - **G0 Tolerance/ G1 Tolerance/ G2 Tolerance:** 
                - Adjusts the numerical threshold for deviation detection.
   - <Kst>Keyboard Shortcuts</Kst>
      - <kbd>Tab</kbd> **Cycle:** Cycle through continuity options.
4. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.
