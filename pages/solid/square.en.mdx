# Square 

<Reference shortcut="" command="Square" button="" />

Square is an XNurbs based command that can create high-quality quad sided surfaces with the parametric feature of explicit control for UV degrees and spans. This command is only available on Studio License. 

## Basic Usage

1. Select the boundary edges you want to use Square Command.
2. Type **Square** in the Command Palette.
3. Set the options in the Command Dialog.
   - <Kst>Command Dialog</Kst>
   - **Continuity:** **Free, G0, G1, G2**
      - **Free:** Option that doesn't respect the boundary continuity, trading precicion continuity and resulting a better surface quality. This option 
      - **G0, G1, G2:** Specify the [continuity of the Surface](/cad-essentials/continuity-curve-and-surface).
   - **Flatness:** Similarly to XNurbs, this option affects the flatness and quality of generated surfaces. Specifying higher value will generate high quality surfaces and lower value will generate low quality surfaces. 
   - **Degree:** Specify the UV degree value.
   - **Spans:** Specify the UV spans value.
   - **Boundary condition:** Specify the condition of UV flow.
        - **Natural:** No requirement for UV Flow.
        - **Normal:** Maintain UV isocurve mutually perpendicular.
        - **Next:** Generate a perpendicular flow of UV if boundary conditions are relatively flat.
        - **Adjacent:** Align V isocurves of the generated surface to adjacent curves. 
   - **Match CVs:** Match CVs of boundary edges.
   - **Weight:** Specify and control how strictly the input constraints for curves and edges of a solid body are applied. A lower value weakens these constraints, allowing for better surface quality and improved reflections, particularly when the input constraints are rough suggestions, of poor quality, or intended to be replaced later. A higher value enforces these constraints, ensuring the UV flow aligns with the given **Degree** and **Span** values to produce the desired surface accuracy.
   - **Scale:** This option allows you to control the size of the red lines that appear on the boundary edges, representing the Edge Deviation Plot. These lines indicate the distance between the boundary edge of the created surface and the input surface. The color red signifies a deviation greater than 0.01mm (1e-5m), highlighting areas where the surface does not precisely match the input geometry.
4. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.

**Lofting with Square**
Alternatively, Square command can be used as a lofting approach with two seperated edges. This approach gives much more flexibility and control of generating a new surface, while with loft, you will most likely get a fixated result of the generated surface.

**Sweeping with Square**
Sweeping with the Square command is possible when two or three touching edges are present.

**Tip**
Similar to the approach in XNurbs, you can execute the command in advance and begin selecting boundary edges, curves and surfaces. This speeds up the workflow efficiently and provides a live preview of surface generation.

**Tip**
The Square command allows you to selectively refit trimmed surfaces on a face and its adjacent surfaces, aligning the orientation of splines to match the natural flow of the surface.
