# Square 

<Reference shortcut="" command="Square" button="" />

Square is an XNurbs based command that can create high-quality quad sided surfaces with the parametric feature of excplicit control for UV degrees and spans.

## Basic Usage

1. Select the boundary edges you want to use Square Command.
2. Type **Square** in the Command Palette.
3. Set the options in the Command Dialog.
   - <Kst>Command Dialog</Kst>
   - **Continuity:** **G0, G1, G2**
   - **Flatness:** This option affects the flatness and quality of generated surfaces. Specifying higher value will generate high quality surfaces and lower value will generate low quality surfaces.
   - **Degree:** Specify the UV degree value.
   - **Spans:** Specify the UV spans value.
   - **Boundary condition:** Specify the condition of UV flow.
        - **Natural:** No requirement for UV Flow.
        - **Normal:** Maintain UV isocurve mutually perpendicular.
        - **Next:** Generate a perpendicular flow of UV if boundary conditions are relatively flat.
   - **Match CVs:** Match CVs of boundary edges.
   - **Weight:* Specify and match the input constraints of curves and edges of a solid body. Lower value will result in neglecting the input constrait which can produce unwanted UV flow, while a higher value will respect the input constraint and try to produce a wanted UV flow with the given Degree and Span values.
   - **Scale:* If **Match CVs** is turned off, Edge Deviation Plot will be displayed as red lines on boundary edges, which is the distance between the boundary edge of the created surface and input value you are inserting. Scale is an option to control the size of the Edge Deviation.  
6. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.
