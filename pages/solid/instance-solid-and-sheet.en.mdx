# Instance Solid and Sheet

<Reference shortcut="" command="Instance" button="In Command Palette"  buttonIcon="button-instance"/>

Create reusable duplicates of a Solid or Sheet object without copying the underlying geometry. An instance stores only transformation data (position, pivot point, rotation, scale) and references the original mesh, so any change to the master geometry is reflected instantly in all its instances. Istances are read-only copies of the parent and cannot be edited independently. Instances aprear with medium to light gray surface edge color in order to differentiate with the parrent object.

Use instance Solid/Sheet when you need many identical parts such as fasteners, panels, or repetitive structiral elements while keeping the model lightweight and easy to maintain. 

## Basic Usage

1. Select a Solid or Sheet as a parent object to instantiate.
2. Search for *Instance* in the Command Palette and execute it.
3. Move the instanced object.
4. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.

# Instance Groups

The process of instancing groups is similar to instancing objects.

When a group is selected and it contains primary geometry, an instance of the group will be created and placed outside of the group folder under its own dedicated category in the Outliner.

## Basic Usage

1. Select a Group in the Outliner to instantiate.
2. Search for *Instance* in the Command Palette and execute it.
3. Move the instanced group.
4. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.

| 1 | Main group with components inside. |
