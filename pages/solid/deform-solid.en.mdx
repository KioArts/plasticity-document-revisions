          - **Reblend:** Reblend the deformed objects. Recalculates the fillets of your objects and translates them again onto removing any unwanted deformations.

**Tip**

To avoid unwanted deformations or inaccurate placement, use the **Unwrap Face command** from the Command Palette on the target object. This generates a correctly mapped surface, which can then be used as an accurate reference face.
