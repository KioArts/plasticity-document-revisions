# XNurbs

<Reference shortcut="" command="XNurbs" button=""/>

XNurbs is a tool that can generate N-sided and quad-sided surfaces with high-quality output. It allows you to bridge gaps and close complex holes on a surface. This command is only available on Studio License.

## Basic Usage

1. Select your boundary edges you want to frame the surface.
2. Use the **XNurbs** command in the Command Palette.
3. Set the options in the Command Dialog.
    - <Kst>Command Dialog</Kst>
          - **Continuity:** **G0, G1, G2**
            - **G0, G1, G2:** Specify the [continuity of the Surface](/cad-essentials/continuity-curve-and-surface).
          - **Quad sided:** Generate untrimmed quad-sided spline surface on a surface area with quad edges.
          - **Flatness:** This option affects the flatness and quality of generated surfaces. Specifying higher value will generate high quality surfaces and lower value will generate low quality surfaces.
          - **Boundary:** 
                - **Natural:** No requirement for U and V Flow.
                - **Normal:** Maintain U and V isocurve mutually perpendicular. For quad-sided surface, this option will keep the isocurves of generated XNurbs surface normal to the boundary curves.
                - **Next:** Generate a perpendicular flow of U and V if boundary conditions are relatively flat. This option works well when **"Quad-sided"** is enabled.
                - **Adjacent:** Align V isocurves of the generated XNurbs surface to adjacent curves. This option only works for Quad-Sided Surface and when **“Quad Sided”** is unselected, this option is the same as “Normal to Curve”.
          - **Quality:** Determine the quality of the generated surface. 
                - **Auto:** Automatic quality generation based on surface.
                - **High:** High surface quality.
                - **Max:** Highest surface quality.
          - **Tolerance:** Specify the tolerance for the generated surface. It is recommended to work with default tolerance value for general surface workflows.
5. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.

**Quad sided**

Quad sided option allows you to create an untrimmed quad-sided spline surface. This is particularly useful when constructing a surface with 4 boundary edges. This option only works with 4 boundary edges as this will create high-quality surface with correct spline orientation.

**Flatness**

Flatness determines the output quality of a surface by increasing and decreasing the input value in the Command Dialog. When using the **Quad sided** option on a quad-sided surface, the value of flatness needs to be between 0.95 - 1.00 for optimum results.

**Quality**

**Auto, High, and Max** options determine the quality of the generated surface. By default, it is on **Auto** but you can select either **High** or **Max** for better but complex surface result.

**Profile Guides**

Unlike with the Loft and Patch Command, Xnurbs is capable of generating surfaces using open profile guides that don't intersect with boundary guides, this gives the flexibility to generate surfaces with ease and the creative opportunity to explore surfaces.
