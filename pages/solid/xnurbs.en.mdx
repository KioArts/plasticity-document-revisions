# XNurbs

<Reference shortcut="" command="XNurbs" button=""/>

XNurbs is a tool that can generate N-sided and quad-sided surfaces with high-quality output. It allows you to bridge gaps and close complex holes on a surface. This command is only available on Studio License.

## Basic Usage

1. Select your boundary edges you want to frame the surface.
2. Use the **XNurbs** command in the Command Palette.
3. Set the options in the Command Dialog.
    - <Kst>Command Dialog</Kst>
          - **Continuity:** **G0, G1, G2**
            - **G0, G1, G2:** Specify the [continuity of the Surface](/cad-essentials/continuity-curve-and-surface).
          - **Quad sided:** Generate an untrimmed quad-sided surface within a four-edged boundary.
          - **Flatness:** Adjust the flatness and quality of generated surfaces. Specifying higher value will generate high quality surfaces and lower value will generate low quality surfaces.
          - **Tension:** Adjusts the tangency strength along surface edges, affecting the smoothness and curvature transition between surfaces. 
          - **Boundary:** 
                - **Natural:** No requirement for UV Flow.
                - **Normal:** Maintain UV isocurves mutually perpendicular.
                - **Next:** Generate a perpendicular flow of UV if boundary conditions are relatively flat when **"Quad-sided"** is enabled.
                - **Adjacent:** Align V isocurves of the generated surface to adjacent curves when **“Quad sided”** is enabled. Having **"Quad sided"** disabled will generate surface results similar to having **"Normal"** enabled.
          - **Quality:** Determine the quality of the generated surface. 
                - **Auto:** Automatic quality generation based on surface.
                - **High:** High surface quality.
                - **Max:** Highest surface quality.
          - **Satisfy tolerances:** Specify the tolerance for the generated surface. It is recommended to work with default tolerance values for general surface workflows. (Default: **Enabled**)
5. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.

**Quad sided**    
This option allows you to create an untrimmed quad-sided spline surface. This is particularly useful when constructing a surface with 4 boundary edges. This option only works with 4 boundary edges as this will create high-quality surface with correct spline orientation.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️"> 
**Flatness**      
Flatness determines the output quality of a surface by increasing and decreasing the input value in the Command Dialog. When using the **Quad sided** option on a quad-sided surface, the value of flatness needs to be between 0.95 - 1.00 for optimum results.

**Quality**       
**Auto, High, and Max** options determine the quality of the generated surface. By default, it is on **Auto** but you can select either **High** or **Max** for better but complex surface result.

**Profile Guides**      
Unlike with the Loft and Patch Command, Xnurbs is capable of generating surfaces using open profile guides that don't intersect with boundary guides, this gives the flexibility to generate surfaces with ease and the creative opportunity to explore surfaces.
