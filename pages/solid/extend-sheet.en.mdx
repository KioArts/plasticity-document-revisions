# Extend Sheet [#extend-sheet]

<Reference shortcut="" command="Extend" button="" />

Extend one or more boundary Edges of the Sheet by specifying the distance. Choose from extension shapes like Liner, Soft and Reflective.

## Basic Usage

1. Select one or more outside Edges of the Sheet you want to extend.
2. When the outside Edges are selected, the default command, **Extend**, is automatically executed.
3. Move the yellow dot to specify the distance.
4. Set the options in the Command Dialog.

        - **Shape:** Specify the shape of the extended surface. Options **Natural**, **Linear**, **Soft**, and **Reflective** will directly influence the shape and curvature of the extended surface during extrusion.
            - **Natural:** Extends the surface "naturally" by continuing the shape described by the original surface just before the start of the extension.
            - **Linear:** Extends the surface in a flat, straight line from the boundary edge, maintaining the current tangent direction without altering curvature.
            - **Soft:** Gradually blends the extension with the existing surface for a smooth transition, preserving both tangent and curvature.
            - **Reflective:** Mirrors the surface curvature and tangency for a symmetrical and seamless continuation, ideal for maintaining surface symmetry.

        **Limit:** Control how far the sheet extends toward a target body.
            - **Minimal:** Extend the sheet to reach the target's outer boundary.
            - **Outside:** Extend the sheet to reach the target's inner boundary. 
            - **Inside:** Extend the sheet to reach the target's outer boundary but if object is partly inside, the inside intersection will be ignored and only the outside part of the sheet will be affected.
        - **Distance:** Specify the distance to extend.
        - **Modify:** When enabled, the Sheet becomes a single Sheet.

5. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.
