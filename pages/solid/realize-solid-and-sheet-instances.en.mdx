# Realize Solid and Sheet Instances

<Reference shortcut="" command="Realize Instances" button="In Command Palette"  buttonIcon="button-realize-instances"/>

Convert selected Solid and Sheet instances into editable solid objects; this creates true geometry that can be modified, but it also raises computational usage, so converting many objects may noticeably increase the scene's computational load.

## Basic Usage

1. Select the Solid or Sheet instances you want to convert.
2. Open the Command Palette, type **Realize Instances**, and execute the command.
3. The instances have been converted into editable objects.

<VideoPlayer fileName="realize-instance-solid"/>

## Realize Instanced Groups

The workflow is identical to the basic usage described above.

<VideoPlayer fileName="realize-instance-group-solid"/>
