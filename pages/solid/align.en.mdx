# Align

<Reference shortcut="" command="Align" button="" />

Align is based on the XNurb command and is used to match two surfaces while maintaining G0, G1, or G2 continuity. You select two edges - one to align and one as a reference. The aligned edge is adjusted to follow the shape and continuity of the reference edge. Options are available for editing the surface's degree and span to support better transition results.

> **Note:** This command is available only with the **Studio License**.

## Basic Usage

1. Select the edge of the surface you want to align and the edge you want to align to.
2. Type **Align** in the Command Palette.
3. Set the options in the Command Dialog.
    - <Kst>Command Dialog</Kst>
        - **Align:**
            - **Continuity:** **G0, G1, G2** Specify the [continuity of the Surface](/cad-essentials/continuity-curve-and-surface).
                - Continuity can be specified individually by clicking on the black circles on the surface.
            - **Tension:** Adjust the curvature transition of a surface.
            - **Blend extra rows:** Choose how many rows of control-points (CVs) to blend when aligning surfaces. Setting it to 0 results to no blending, while higher values blend more rows for a smoother connection. If the value is as high as or higher than the total rows, the surface fully adjusts to match the target.
            - **Input shape influence:** Adjust how much the original shape affects the aligned result.
        - **Partial Alignment:** Controls how the new surface blends at its start and end.
                    - **Partial start:** Adjusts how much of the surface's start blends with the target.
                    - **Partial end:** Adjusts how much of the surface's end blends with the target.
            - **Degree:** Specify the UV degree value.
            - **Spans:** Specify the UV spans value.
            - **Boundary:** Specify the condition of UV flow.
            - **Natural:** No requirement for UV Flow.
            - **Normal:** Maintain UV isocurve mutually perpendicular.
            - **Next:** Generate a perpendicular flow of UV if boundary conditions are relatively flat.
            - **Adjacent:** Align V isocurves of the generated surface to adjacent curves. 
        - **Analysis:** Analyzes the continuity of surface edges
                - **Continuity:** Verify the continuity of edges:
                    - **G0:** Position continuity check.
                    - **G1:** Tangent continuity check.
                    - **G2:** Curvature continuity check.
                - **G0 Scale / G1 Scale / G2 Scale:** 
                    - Adjust tolerance scales for respective continuity checks.

        - <kbd>Tab</kbd> **Cycle continuity:** Cycle through continuity options.
        - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> **Show original:** Show original surface state (quasi mode).
4. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.

## Partial Align

Partially align a new surface to a target surface by controlling how much of the start and end is blended. This allows for a tapered or gradual transition.

1. Select the edge of the surface you want to align and the edge you want to align to.
2. Type **Align** in the Command Palette.
3. Set the options in the Command Dialog.
    - <Kst>Command Dialog</Kst>
        - **Partial Alignment:** Controls how the new surface blends at its start and end.
                - **Partial start:** Adjusts how much of the surface's start blends with the target.
                - **Partial end:** Adjusts how much of the surface's end blends with the target.
    - <Kst>Keyboard Shortcuts</Kst>
        - <kbd>Tab</kbd> **Cycle continuity:** Cycle through continuity options.
        - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> **Show original:** Show original surface state (quasi mode).

## Align Multiple Surfaces

Align more than two adjacent surfaces at once to enable broader blending across multiple areas.
