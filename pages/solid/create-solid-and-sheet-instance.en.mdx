# Create Solid and Sheet Instance

<Reference shortcut="" command="Create Instance" button="In Command Palette"  buttonIcon="button-instance"/>

Create reusable duplicates of a Solid or Sheet object without copying the underlying geometry. An instance stores transformation data (position, pivot point, rotation, scale), material data and references the original Solid object, so any change to the master geometry is reflected instantly in all its instances. Istances are read-only copies of the parent and cannot be edited independently. Instances aprear with medium to light gray surface edge color in order to differentiate with the parrent object.

<Callout>
Use the **Create Instance** command when you need many identical parts such as fasteners, panels, or repetitive structural elements while keeping the model lightweight and easy to maintain.

Instances work with array commands such as [**Curve Array**](/common/curve-array), [**Radial Array**](/common/radial-array), and [**Rectangular Array**](/common/rectangular-array).  

Instances can also be used with the [**Mirror**](/common/mirror) command, enabling live symmetry where changes to the master geometry updates all mirrored instances automatically.
</Callout>
## Basic Usage

1. Select the Solid or Sheet you want to use as the parent object.
2. Open the Command Palette, type **Create Instance**, and execute the command.
3. Move the newly created instance to the desired location.
4. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.

**Note:** Once an instance has been created, you can duplicate that instance any number of times, and all of the duplicates will continue to reflect any changes made to the original parent object.

## Instance Groups

The process of instancing groups is similar to instancing objects.

When a group is selected and it contains primary geometry, an instance of the group will be created and placed outside of the group folder under its own dedicated category in the Outliner.

| Number | Description |
| :----: | ----------- |
| 1 | Main group with components inside. |
| 2 | Parent objects that will be instanced. |
| 3 | Instance of main group allocated outside of the main group under the category **"Instances"**. |

### Basic Usage

1. Select a Group in the Outliner to instantiate.
2. Search for **Create Instance** in the Command Palette and execute it.
3. Move the instanced group.
4. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.
