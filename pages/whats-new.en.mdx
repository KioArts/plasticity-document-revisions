# Update Information Version 2024.2

Release date: September 5, 2024

## New Commands 

### Square Command 
Square Command is an XNurbs based command that allows you to create various surfaces with excplicit control for UV degrees and spans. It is available only on Studio License. For more information on Square Command, click [here](/solid/square).

<VideoPlayer fileName="square-0"/>

### Deform Command
Deform Command allows you to wrap existing solid objects and wire bodies onto regular and irregular surfaces, allowing you to create complex and unique patterns and wrappings. For more information on Deform Command, click [here](/solid/deform-solid-and-sheet) for Solid and Sheet and [here](/sketch/deform-curve) for Curves.

<VideoPlayer fileName="deform-curve"/>

### Reverse Command 
Reverse Command is a command that allows you to reverse the direction of a curve and normal direction of a sheet. This can be useful for the [Pipe Tool](/solid/pipe) as you can reverse the direction of the Pipe when using the Scale option. Refer [here](/sketch/reverse-curve) for Reverse Curve and [here](/solid/reverse-sheet) for Reverse Sheet.

## Improved Command Features

### Rebuild Command

Both Rebuild Face and Curve command have a new feature called "Explicit Control" which you can control the value of degrees and number of spans for UV direction. For more information, click [here](/solid/rebuild). 

### XNurbs Command

Introducing a new boundary alignment option called "Next", allowing you to generate a perpendicular flow of UV whenever boundary conditions are relatively flat. Additionally, XNurbs now includes an indicator to display warning messages whenever conflicting inputs are detected. For more information, click [here](/solid/xnurbs). 

### Bridge Vertex and Curve Command

Continuity gizmo has been implemented to enhance interactivity, providing improved control and a more efficient workflow. For more information on Bridge Command, click [here](/sketch/bridge).   

### Square Command 

Square Command now has a "Match-CVs" option which can produce higher quality surfaces. For more information, click [here](/solid/square).

### Rectangular and Radial Array

The Rectangular and Radial Array commands now support arraying faces that are part of a body. This feature is especially effective when arraying fillets. Moreover, both commands now have individually different distance modes - *Rectangular Array* [**Extend** and **Spacing**] and *Radial Array* [**Total** and **Spacing]** - allowing you to control the distance and spacing behaviour of duplicated objects. For more information on Rectangular Array click [here](/common/rectangular-array) and [here](/common/radial-array) for Radial Array.

### Polygon Command

Polygon Command now remembers last used number of vertices.

### Unwrap Command 

The Unwrap Command now generates a flat sheet of the selected face from a solid, which can be used in conjunction with the [Deform Command](/solid/deform) for further modifications.

### Draft Command

Introducing a Gizmo feature where you can control the position of the reference face and having the option to select multiple faces to draft with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> button. This can be applied to non-unifrom planar surface, however, without the option to offset the reference face. Refer to [here](/solid/draft-face).

### Patch Command

Patch Command can now create sheets from a close edge selection of a solid. Refer to [here](/solid/patch).

## Removed Commands 

### Rebuild Edge Command 

It has been removed due to its unsafe implementation and has been replaced with the delete command for edges. This strategy should allow to join more fractured edges.

## Outliner  

1. **Construction Planes** -  Construction Planes can now be renamed in the Outliner, allowing for better organization and management. This improvement eliminates unnecessary steps when searching for the correct construction plane, streamlining task selection and workflow. For more information on Construction Planes, click [here](/plasticity-essentials/construction-plane).
2. **Meshes and Images** - Outliner now separates meshes and images into their own sections rather than "empties". 
3. **Context Menu for Selected Items in Outliner** - Context menu in the Outliner with right mouse button now has a new function "move selected items to root" whenever you have selected items in a group. 
4. **Context Menu for Group** - Context menu in the Outliner with right mouse button now has a new group function "Group selection here" and "Group selection at root". 
5. **Grouping items** - If all items are in the same group then creating a new group will be located in tha same directory, otherwise at root directory.
6. **Group Hierarchy** - Deleting a group moves its children to its immediate parent, rather than root.
5. **Assigning Material** - Transparent materials are now displayed with 50% transparency, even when using default and custom [matcaps](/plasticity-essentials/view-mode) in non-render mode.

### Measurements and Measurements Panel

 1. **Measurements Enhancement** - Measurements can now be moved when selected in the Outliner and used in conjunction with the Move Command, enabling you to enter specific values directly in the viewport for more precise adjustments.
 2. **Measurements Enhancement** - Measurements can be coppied to clipboard in user's preferred units.
 3. **Measurement Panel** - Measurement Panel now displays the angle between two planes. 
 4. **Surface Class** - Lower-right panel in the Measurements Panel now introduces surface class, allowing specific selection of faces.
