# Update Information Version 2024.2

Release date: September 5, 2024

## New Commands 

### Square Command 

### Deform Command

### Reverse Command 
- Reverse Command can reverse the direction of a curve and normal direction of a sheet. 

## Improved and New Command Features

### Rebuild Command
    - Rebuild Face - Introducing now "Explicit Control" with which you can control the value of degrees and spans. Studio-exclusive feature.
    - Rebuild Curve - The command now allows explicit control of degrees and spans.
### XNurbs Command
    - Introducing a new boundary alignment option called "Next", allowing you to generate a perpendicular flow of UV whenever boundary conditions are relatively flat. For more information, click [here](/solid/xnurbs).
    - The XNurbs Command now includes an indicator to display warning messages whenever conflicting inputs are detected. 
### Bridge Vertex and Curve Command
    - Continuity gizmo has been implemented to enhance interactivity, providing improved control and a more efficient workflow. For more information on Bridge Command, click [here](/sketch/bridge).   
### Square Command 
    - Square Command now has a "Match-CVs" option which can produce higher quality surfaces. For more information, click [here](/solid/square).
### Rectangular and Radial Array 
    - The Rectangular and Radial Array commands now support arraying faces that are part of a body. This feature is especially effective when arraying fillets. 
    #### Distance Mode
    Moreover, both commands now have individually different distance modes, allowing you to control the distance and spacing behaviour. For more information on Rectangular Array click [here](/common/rectangular-array) and [here](/common/radial-array) for Radial Array.
### Polygon Command 
    - Polygon Command now remembers last used number of vertices.
### Unwrap Command 
    - The Unwrap Command now generates a flat sheet of the selected face from a solid, which can be used in conjunction with the [Deform Command](/solid/deform) for further modifications.
### Draft Command 
    - Introducing a Gizmo feature where you can control the position of the reference face and having the option to select multiple faces to draft with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>. This can be applied to non-unifrom planar surface, however, without the option to offset the reference face. Refer to [here](/solid/draft-face).
### Patch 
    - Patch Command can now create sheets from a close edge selection of a solid. Refer to [here](/solid/patch).

## Removed Commands
- Rebuild Edge Command - It has been removed due to its unsafe implementation and has been replaced with the delete command for edges. This strategy should allow to join more fractured edges.

## Outliner 
- Construction Planes can now be renamed in the Outliner, allowing for better organization and management. This improvement eliminates unnecessary steps when searching for the correct construction plane, streamlining task selection and workflow. For more information on Construction Planes, click [here](/plasticity-essentials/construction-plane). 
- Outliner now separates meshes and images into their own sections rather than "empties". 
- Transparent materials are now displayed with 50% transparency, even when using default and custom [matcaps](/plasticity-essentials/view-mode) in non-render mode.

## File Formats Enhacement

### OBJ
    - Export OBJ with Face and Surface UVs.
    - Export OBJ with MTL file.

    ![OBJ](/img/obj-2024.2.png)
### STEP
    - Export STEP with colors and assembly information (groups). 
    - Import STEP preserves colors.
### Meshes and Images
    - Snap to Empties (OBJ, Reference Images).
    - OBJ Empties - Vertex snap feature. 
        - Snapping to Vertex is now possible on OBJ meshes whenever your mouse is close to the vertex point. You can do basic reverse engineering on the meshes with any sketch tool but the following tools are best suited for this task:
        - Line, Spline Curve and Control Point Curve, Three point circle, Three point rectangle, and Constrained Surface.

    - Image empties corner snaps. 
- .Plasticity -
    - Import and Appending Plasticity documents preserves groups, names, and materials.
- Parasolid (.*x_t/x_b) - 
    - Import Parasolid files support colors, names, assemblies but do not support instanes yet. 
### New Import Formats
- 3MF Import
- SVG Import


### Measurements 
- Measurements are now possible to be moved when selected in the outliner and in conjestion with the move command, allowing you to tweak measurement position.

### Text
- 4 additional fonts

### Groups
- Grouping items - If all items are in the same group then creating a new group will be located in tha same directory, otherwise at root directory.
- Item/Group rightclick menu - "move selected items to root"
- Items in Outliner now have two grouping commands in right click menu - "Group here" and "Group at root"
- Groups - Deleting a group moves its children to its immediate parent, rather than root.
### Shader
Transparent materials - Materials with transparent value less than 1 will appear 50% transparent when using matcaps in non-render mode.
### Snaps
- Freestyle Rotate - Now has a Parallel snap feature. 


### Misc.
- New Autosave option - allows to save current saved file every 10 minutes. This setting can be configurable in the Preference section.
- Measurements panel - Show angle between two selected planes.

Patch Hole

- Patch Command with edges selected of a solid will generate a new sheet body.

Orbit Controls
- Touchpad - Track orbit point
