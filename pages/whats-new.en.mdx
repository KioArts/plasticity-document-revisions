# Plasticity 25.1 Release Notes  

Plasticity 25.1 introduces a wide array of enhancements and new features aimed at improving surface modeling workflows, enhancing usability, and streamlining the user experience. Below is a detailed overview of the updates:  

## 1. New Commands

### New Slide Command  
- **CV Sliding on Curves and Solids**  
Users can slide control vertices (CVs) on spline curves and surface hulls, guided by the direction of the CVs, allowing for precise adjustments during modeling.

### New Section Analysis Command
- **Section Analysis**  
Section Analysis is a feature that allows users to slice through their 3D model to reveal its interior structure. This helps identify whether internal components are properly aligned or interfering with each other. It is especially useful for architectural, engineering, and design visualization.

## 2. Modeling Enhancements

### Square Command Updates
- **New "Free" Option**  
Introducing a new continuity option that trades G0 precision for higher surface quality. 
- **"Adjacent" Boundary Option**  
Introducing a new boundary condition that uses adjacent trimmed edges for creating smoother transitions.
- **"Tension" Feature**  
Introducing a new feature that allows users to adjust surface curvature tension, similar to tools in Lofting and Bridging workflows. This provides greater control over surface shaping.
- **Refit Trimmed Surfaces**  
The Square command can rebuild any four-sided trimmed surface with user-specified Degree, Span, and Continuity settings. Acting as a refit tool, it naturally aligns the splines of the trimmed surface to match its internal shape.

### Xnurbs Enhancements
- **"Adjacent" Boundary Option**  
Introducing a new boundary condition that uses adjacent trimmed edges for creating smoother transitions.  
- **"Tension" Feature**  
Introducing a new feature that allows users to adjust surface curvature tension, similar to tools in Lofting and Bridging workflows. This provides greater control over surface shaping.

### CV Move Editing 
- **Proportional and Mirrored Transformations**   
The Move command allows proportional editing of surface CVs and supports mirrored transformations. 

[Learn more](/common/move#move-control-point)

### Raise Degree Command Enhancement
- The [**Raise Degree**](/solid/raise-surface-degree) command can now be executed when a surface CV is selected.  

### Toggle Points Command Enhancement 
- The [**Toggle Points**](/sketch/toggle-points) command can now be executed when a curve CV is selected. 

## 3. Sketching and Curve Tools

### Curve Rebuild Enhancement  
- **Weight Option**  
The Rebuild command now includes a new option **"Weight"** when using explicit control to rebuild a curve. 

[Learn more](/sketch/rebuild-curve)

### Snapping Enhancements  
- **New Tangent Snapping**  
Introducing **Tan/Tan** snapping for ellipses and general splines. 
- **New "Control Point" Snap Option**   
A new **"Control point"** snap is now available in the **"Object Snaps"** subpanel.

### Sketching Enhancement
- **Region Deletion Behavior**  
Deleting regions now automatically removes the curves that bound them. 

### Trimming Optimization
Trimming operations for densely packed 2D sketches, such as hexagonal grids, have been optimized. 

## 4. Transformation Tools

### Transform Command Enhancements
- **Stored Transform Pivots**  
Transformation pivots are now saved with objects when using Move, Rotate and Scale commands. 
- **Customizable Transform Options**  
Users can specify the transform orientation (**Local**, **CPlane**, **World**) and pivot point (**Bounding Box**, **Median**, **Last Selected**), offering greater flexibility in transformations.

## 5. Surface Tools

### Sheet Extension Enhancements
- **New "Natural" Mode**  
Introducing a new **"Natural"** mode for extending sheets.
- **Surface Extension**     
Surface extension modes can now be toggled using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key.  

[Learn more](/solid/extend-sheet)

### Construction Plane Enhancement
Users can now create a construction plane that passes through two selected points and aligns with the camera view. Ideal for planarizing a hull while maintaining alignment with the view direction.

### Bridge Surface
- **New "Tension" Option**  
New **"Tension"** option now available for Bridge Surface command. 

[Learn more](/solid/bridge-surface)

## 6. Selection Conversion

### Selection Conversion Enhancement
- **New Conversion Options**  
Selecting a wire body now allows conversion to points (Vertex and Control-Vertex) and vice versa, while regions can be converted into their bounding curves.

## 7. User Interface and Usability Enhancements

### New User Interface Design
Plasticity has been updated with a modern, streamlined UI while retaining key functional elements from previous versions. Features are now better positioned and equipped with intuitive new icons to enhance usability and workflow efficiency. This update also lays the foundation for future UI improvements.
