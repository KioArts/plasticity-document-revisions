# Publish To Web

<Reference shortcut="" command="Publish To Web" button=""  buttonIcon=''/>

Uploads a .plasticity file to the cloud and generates a unique private URL that opens in a new browser tab. The link can be shared with anyone for read-only viewing. Once the link is distributed it becomes public. Each uploaded document supports multiple revisions; you can manage and delete these revisions on the [**My Documents**](https://share.plasticity.xyz/me/) page.

- Only the mesh representation of the model is published so no CAD geometry or source files are included and the file cannot be downloaded.
- The feature is disabled by default. Enable it via **Preferences > Web Publishing**.
- Publish to Web also exports material information from the Assets menu.
- Mesh data is **view-only**; direct modeling or modification of the published mesh is not possible.
- Regardless of license type, every user receives **5 GB** of cloud storage.
