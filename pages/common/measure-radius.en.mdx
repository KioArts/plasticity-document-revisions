# Measure Radius

<Reference shortcut="" command="Measure Radius" button="In Command Palette" buttonIcon='' />

Measures the radius of a solid surface edge or a curve (sketch) and creates a radius annotation.

## Basic Usage

1. Open the Command Palette, type **"Measure Radius",** and run the command.  
2. Select the type of object to measure:
| Type |  Note  | 
| ---- |  ----  |
|   Solid   |  click the surface edge you wish to measure.  |  
|   Curve   |  click the sketch whose radius you want.  |   
3. Move the mouse in the viewport to set the length of the annotation line, then click left or right mouse button to confirm.  
4. The measured value appears next to the **R** symbol, indicating a radius. The measurement is also added to the **Outliner** under **Measurements -> Radius**.
