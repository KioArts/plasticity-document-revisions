   - `Q`: **Union**: Unites with the Boolean target.
   - `W`: **Difference**: Subtracts from the Boolean target.
   - `Shift`+`E`: **Intersect**: Creates a solid at the intersection with the Boolean target.
   - `B`: **New Body**: Creates a new solid. The Boolean operation is cancelled.
   - `T`: **Keep Tool**: The Boolean operation is performed, and a new solid is also created.
   - `X`: **X axis**: Constrains to the X-axis.
