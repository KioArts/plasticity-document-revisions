### Alias Theory 9 - Fillet Order of Operations - YouTube

Summary:
- The video discusses the importance of the order of operations when applying fillets in 3D design, drawing parallels to the concept in mathematics.
- The general rule is to go from large to small fillets. Demonstrating on a cube, the presenter shows that applying a larger fillet first and then a smaller one results in a cleaner design.
- Reversing the order, applying a smaller fillet first and then a larger one, leads to errors and weird shapes, proving that the order matters.
- If the design requires equal-sized fillets on all edges, the presenter advises evaluating the angles between surfaces. Fillets should be applied first to surfaces with more open angles for better results.
- The video concludes by showing examples where ignoring the angle considerations leads to errors, emphasizing the importance of the correct order of operations for fillets.
