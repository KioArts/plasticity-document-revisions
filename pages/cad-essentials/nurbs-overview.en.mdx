# Introduction to NURBS

## What is NURBS?

Non-Uniform Rational Basis-Splines (NURBS) is a mathematical model widely used in computer graphics to represent curves and surfaces. 

    - **Non-Uniform** - Refers to the parameterization of the curve. Non-Uniform curves allow, among other things, the presence of multi-knots, which are needed to represent Bezier curves.
    - **Rational** - Refers to the underlying mathematical representation. This property allows NURBS to represent exact conics (Such as parabolic curves, circles, and ellipses) in addition to free-form curves.
    - **Basis-Splines** - Refers to piecewise polynomial curves (splines) that have a parametric representation.

They offer significant flexibility and precision in handling both standard geometric shapes and freeform designs. NURBS is integral to various applications, including computer-aided design (CAD), manufacturing (CAM), and engineering (CAE).
   
Unlike polygon-based modelling, which relies on a network of flat surfaces (faces) connected by edges, NURBS allows for the creation of continuous, infinitely smooth curves and surfaces without visible faceting.

This makes NURBS an essential tool for industries that require high precision, such as automotive design, aerospace engineering, product manufacturing, architecture, and industrial design. Not limited to this, NURBS can also be used in other fields such as animation, games, scientific visualization, and others.

The NURBS 3D data type can easily be exported to other CAD software applications by exporting the solid objects using standard file formats such as .STEP, .IGES, .STL, and others.

## How does NURBS work?

### NURBS Components

NURBS models are built using several key components:

    #### Control Points   
        
        Control Points or Control Vertexes are points that define the shape of a NURBS curve or surface. Unlike polygons, which have sharp edges, NURBS control points act like magnets that pull the curve toward them, influencing its form without breaking its smoothness. Increasing the number of CVs increases local control, but excessive points can introduce unnecessary complexity.

    #### Spans    

        A span is a segment of a NURBS curve or surface defined between two knot values. It represents a portion of the curve that is mathematically constructed using a specific set of control points and basis functions. In simpler terms, each span is an individual building block of the overall curve. Multiple spans can be stitched together to form a smooth, continuous, and more complex curve or surface shape. 

        ![Span Curves Example](/img/span-curves.png)

        Each span also has a starting and ending point, defined by vertices. However, to better distinguish between these classes and understand them in context-sensitive situations, the term "Edit Points" can be used to provide clearer terminology in this context.

    #### Degree  
        
        The degree of a NURBS curve or surface determines how smooth or complex its shape is, and it's based on a mathematical formula (a polynomial). This degree is always a positive whole number such as 1, 2, or 3 - and never zero or a fraction. It directly affects the smoothness, complexity, and flexibility of a curve and surface.
     
        ![Degree Example](/img/degree-curve-nurbs.png)

        | Degree | Name | Control-Points per Span | Description |
        | :------: | ---- | :----------------------: |----------- | 
        | 1 | Linear | 2 | Straight-line segments connecting control points. | 
        | 2 | Quadratic | 3 | Curves with a single bend between control-points. | 
        | 3 | Cubic | 4 | Smooth curves offering a balance between flexibility and control. | 
        | 4 | Quartic | 5 | Curves with increased smoothness and flexibility compared to cubic curves. | 
        | 5 | Quintic | 6 | Highly flexible curves capable of achieving very smooth transitions. |

        Terminology such as linear, quadratic, cubic, and quintic refers to the degree of a curve. The degree indicates the highest power of the polynomial used to define the curve. Higher-degree curves (e.g., cubic or quintic) allow for more complex and flexible shapes, while lower-degree curves (e.g., linear) produce simpler, straighter forms. Although higher degrees offer smoother transitions and greater control, they also increase computational complexity. In practice, degree 3 (cubic) curves are most commonly used in CAD software, as they provide an ideal balance between shape flexibility and computational efficiency.

    #### Order

        The order of a NURBS curve is defined as one more than its degree (Order = Degree + 1). While the degree determines the curve's mathematical complexity and smoothness, the order reflects how many control points are used to calculate each segment of the curve. This distinction comes from the underlying math: the recursive basis functions that build the curve rely on the order to define how control points influence the shape. In practice, degree shapes the curve; order defines the number of contributing control points at any given time.

        | Term | Description |
        | :---: | ---------- | 
        | Degree | The highest exponent in the curve's polynomial. Controls smoothness and curvature complexity. | 
        | Order | One more than the degree. Mainly used in NURBS terminology and math. |

    #### Knots  

        Knots are parameters that define how much influence each control point has on the shape of the curve. They help determine whether a curve bends sharply or remains smooth across different sections.

    #### Weight 

        Each control point in a NURBS model has a weight, which affects how strongly it pulls the curve or surface toward itself. By adjusting weights, you can create precise shapes like perfect circles and ellipses. 

        The higher the weight of a CV, the sharper the spline around that CV. For large weight values, the spline will almost go through the CV. Similarly, weights smaller than one tend to flatten the spline in the area influenced by that CV.

        The effect of CV weight is shown below.

    #### NURBS Surfaces

        A NURBS surface extends the concept of NURBS curves into two parametric directions (U and V) and is essentially a network of NURBS curves connected smoothly in two dimensions. A dedicated chapter for UVN is written [here](/cad-essentials/uvn-coordinate-system).

        A NURBS surface has a topology similar to that of a Mesh primitive. In a NURBS surface, each node of the UV coordinate matrix represents a CV connected by rows and columns to form a NURBS hull. This allows modeling of complex smooth surfaces, whose shape is changeable simply by moving the CVs

        NURBS solids are surfaces or polysurfaces that form a closed volume. It defines thickness distribution, which makes volume and strenght calculations seamless, along with other examples such as 3D printing. It is recommended to work with closed volumes and not  open surfaces as that will cause production issues - such as not visuallizing material filling. By joining solid models (sheets), this will constitute as a close single solid.
