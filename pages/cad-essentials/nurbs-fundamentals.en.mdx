## What is NURBS?

Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) are a mathematical model widely used in computer graphics to represent curves and surfaces. They offer significant flexibility and precision in handling both standard geometric shapes and freeform designs. NURBS are integral to various applications, including computer-aided design (CAD), manufacturing (CAM), and engineering (CAE).
   
Unlike polygon-based modelling, which relies on a network of flat surfaces (faces) connected by edges, NURBS allows for the creation of continuous, infinitely smooth curves and surfaces without visible faceting.

This makes NURBS an essential tool for industries that require high precision, such as automotive design, aerospace engineering, product manufacturing, and architecture. It is also used in animation and visual effects for creating organic, smooth shapes.

## How does NURBS work?

### NURBS Components

NURBS models are built using several key components:

    #### Control Points   
        
        Control Points or Control Vertexes are points that define the shape of a NURBS curve or surface. Unlike polygons, which have sharp edges, NURBS control points act like magnets that pull the curve toward them, influencing its form without breaking its smoothness.
	   
	    Increasing the number of CVs increases local control, but excessive points can introduce unnecessary complexity.

    #### Spans    

        A span is a section of the NURBS curve or surface between two knot values. You can think of it as a segment where a portion of the curve is mathematically defined using a set of control points and basis functions. In simpler terms, each span is an individual piece of the overall curve. This can be used in stitching together multiple spans in order to smoothly shape a longer or complex curve shape. 

        ![Span Image Example](/img/span-nurbs.png)

        Each span also has a starting and ending point. These points are deffined with Vertexes, however, to better diversify these classes and understand them better in context-sensitive situations,  A terminological word can be used in understanding this context can be used with "Edit Points".

    #### Degree  
        
        The degree of a NURBS curve or surface tells how smooth or complex its shape is, and it's based on a kind of math formula (a polynomial). This degree is always a positive whole number such as 1, 2, or 3 - and never zero or a fraction. It directly affects the smoothness, complexity, and flexibility of a curve and surface.
     
        | Degree | Name | Control-Points per Span | Description |
        | :------: | ---- | :----------------------: |----------- | 
        | 1 | Linear | 2 | Straight-line segments connecting control points. | 
        | 2 | Quadratic | 3 | Curves are curves with a single bend between control-points. | 
        | 3 | Cubic | 4 | Smooth curves offering a balance between flexibility and control. | 
        | 4 | Quartic | 5 | Curves with increased smoothness and flexibility compared to cubic curves. | 
        | 5 | Quintic | 6 | Highly flexible curves capable of achieving very smooth transitions. |

        Terminology such as linear, quadratic, cubic, and quintic are used to describe the number of degree for a curve. A higher degree curve (e.g., cubic or quintic) allows for more complex shapes, while a lower degree curve (e.g., linear) results in straighter forms. Higher degrees create smoother curves but increase computational complexity. Degree 3 (cubic) is the most commonly used in CAD software due to its balance between flexibility and performance.
     
        The order of a NURBS curve is a positive whole number equal to (degree+1). Consequently, the degree is equal to (order-1). 


    #### Knots and Knot Vector   

        Knots are parameters that define how much influence each control point has on the shape of the curve. They help determine whether a curve bends sharply or remains smooth across different sections.

    #### Weight 

        Each control point in a NURBS model has a weight, which affects how strongly it pulls the curve or surface toward itself. By adjusting weights, you can create precise shapes like perfect circles and ellipses. 

        The higher the weight of a CV, the sharper the spline around that CV. For large weight values, the spline will almost go through the CV. Similarly, weights smaller than one tend to flatten the spline in the area influenced by that CV.

        The effect of CV weight is shown below.

## NURBS Surfaces

A NURBS surface extends the concept of NURBS curves into two parametric directions (U and V) and is essentially a network of NURBS curves connected smoothly in two dimensions. A dedicated chapter for UVN is written [here](/cad-essentials/uvn-coordinate-system).
A NURBS surface has a topology similar to that of a Mesh primitive. In a NURBS surface, each node of the UV coordinate matrix represents a CV connected by rows and columns to form a NURBS hull. This allows modeling of complex smooth surfaces, whose shape is changeable simply by moving the CVs

NURBS solids are surfaces or polysurfaces that form a closed volume. It defines thickness distribution, which makes volume and strenght calculations seamless, along with other examples such as 3D printing. It is recommended to work with closed volumes and not  open surfaces as that will cause production issues - such as not visuallizing material filling. By joining solid models (sheets), this will constitute as a close single solid.

## Advantages and Applications of NURBS

### Advantages of NURBS over Polygonal Modeling 

| Feature | NURBS | Polygon Mesh |
| ------- | ----- | ------------ |
| Accuracy | Mathematical precision | Approximate with facets |
| Editability | Control points, weights, knots | Vertex-based, less intuitive |
| Scalability | Resolution-independent | More polygons needed for detail |
| Smoothness | Always smooth | Requires subdivision for smoothness |
| Compatibility | Used in CAD, CAM, engineering | More common in VFX, gaming |

### Common Applications 

**Automotive and Aerospace Design** - Car exteriors, aircraft fuselages, and aerodynamic surfaces require **precise, smooth curves**.

**Industrial and Product Design** - Consumer products like smartphones, watches, and appliances use NURBS for accurate manufacturing.

**Architectural Modeling** - Complex curved structures and parametric surfaces in modern buildings rely on NURBS modeling. 

**Medical and Biomechanical Engineering** - Prosthetics, dental implants, and bioengineering models often use NURBS due to their accuracy.
