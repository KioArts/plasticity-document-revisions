# Shortcuts and Command Palette

In Plasticity, you can execute features through three methods: the icons at the bottom of the screen, keyboard shortcuts, and the command palette.

## Icons at the Bottom of the Screen

- Bottom left: Frequently used features like move and rotate are listed here.
- Bottom right: Available features change depending on what is currently selected.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- Frequently used features have keyboard shortcuts assigned.
- Refer to [Shortcuts list](shortcuts.en.md)

## Command Palette and Favorites

- Features without icons or shortcuts can be executed from the command palette.
- Pressing the `F` shortcut in the work area will display the command palette, where you can enter the feature name to execute.
- You can also assign any shortcut to a feature in the command palette, or pin your favorite features.
