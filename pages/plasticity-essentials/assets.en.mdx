# Assets

The Assets section displays all materials currently in use within the active Plasticity project. 

![Assets](/img/assets.png)

## Displayed Materials

- All materials you create appear under the "Used Materials" section.
- Modifying a material's properties updates all associated objects in real time. 
- Materials cannot be removed from the list.
- This section can serve as a color palette when assigning new materials.

## Select Materials

- Right-clicking a material opens the "Select All with This Material" option, allowing you to quickly select all objects sharing that material.

# Physical Materials

In the bottom section of the Assets panel, you'll find a broad selection of Physical Materials that come with Plasticity. To view them properly, make sure [Render Mode](/plasticity-essentials/view-mode) is activated so the shaders are visualized on the objects. 

## Editing Physical Materials

Each material comes with a preset containing unique material properties. You can edit these properties by pressing <kbd>M</kbd> on your keyboard.

- **Texture scale:** Adjusts the overall scale of the texture.
- **Blending:** Controls the Tri-Planar Projection blending. A value of 0 applies maximum blending, while 7 applies no blending at the borders. Useful for hiding obvious seams.
- **Rotate:** Rotates the material applied to the object.   
        **Rotate X:** Rotates the entire material around the X-axis in world coordinates.
        **Rotate Y:** Rotates the entire material around the Y-axis in world coordinates.
        **Rotate Z:** Rotates the entire material around the Z-axis in world coordinates.

**Note**
- Exporting the object as a mesh or CAD file will not preserve the physical material properties when imported into DCC (Digital Content Creation) software such as Blender or Maya. These materials are intended for visualization within Plasticity, allowing you to present the concept of an object using material shaders.
