# Render Mode

## Render Mode

Render Mode is located in the View Mode menu in the top-right corner of the screen. You can enable it by clicking the sphere icon **(1)**. Once turned on, the shading in the viewport will update to show a more rendered look for your objects.

You can switch between Plasticity's built-in HDRIs by clicking on them. The selected HDRI will be applied to the environment right away and updating the scene immediately - though this won't affect the viewport background.

- Available HDRIs:

## Ambient Occlusion (AO)

When Render Mode is enabled, Ambient Occlusion remains always active. You can modify the radius (1) and falloff (2) values in the Appearance section in the [Preferences](/plasticity-essentials/preferences) menu. Changes are applied in real time.

### Installing Custom HDRIs

1. Prepare your custom HDRI files, ensuring that EXR and PNG files have identical names.
2. Find the `.plasticity` directory on your operating system and create a new folder named "environment".
<Tabs items={['Windows', 'macOS', 'Linux']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
    Navigate to `C:/Users/<username>/.plasticity`.
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
    Navigate to `~/.plasticity`.
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
    Navigate to `C:/usr/lib/plasticity/resources/app/.webpack/main/dot-plasticity`.
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
3. Move your custom HDRI files into this folder, then restart Plasticity to apply the changes.

**Tip**     
- It's recommended to use a 1K resolution for the EXR file to keep file sizes optimized (though higher resolutions are supported if needed). The PNG file can be any 1:1 ratio, but 512x512 pixels with a transparent background is advised. Both files should be saved with at least a 16-bit color depth.

**Note**     
- Make sure you enable the option to view hidden folders in your operating system to access the `.plasticity` directory.
