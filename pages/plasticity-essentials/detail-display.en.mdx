# Detail Display 
- The Detail Display window is located at the bottom right of the screen. 
- The Detail Display window displays information such as number indicator of object selections, object type and sub-type, allignment and degree information, dimension property of objects (volume, area, perimeter) and curves (lenght, circumference and radius distance), and world coordinate positioning.

## Number Indicator

## X Object type and classification:
- The detail display window can display 5 types of objects based on selection. Each type of object has their own sub-type classification and it is selection-based driven.

## Number Indicator
- The number indicator is a feature that displays how many object selections you have on the detail display window. it displays the object type in their respective group (1) and displays a sub-type count to it too (2).

## Object Type and Sub-type
- Object type in the detail display window, displays the object type based on the selection and type of selection mode. For example, if face selection mode (1) is activated and you select a few faces on a cube and a simple conic fillet shape (2), it will display you the type of selection you have (3 Faces) (3) and alongside its sub-type selection (2 Planes and 1 Cylinder) (4).

## Allignment and Degree Information
- The detail display window can display the degree between two selected objects and the allignment information in colrelation with two selected objects based on selection and type of selection mode. 

### Allignment Information

## Dimension Property
- In the detail display window, there is a section where you can find dimension information based on object selections and the type of selection. 

1. - With Selection Mode: Body (<kbd> Number 4 </kbd>) activated, you can see the following display information:

| Solid | Sheet | Image | Mesh | 
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| Object Type, Object Dimensions and World Coordinate Positioning | Object Type, Object Dimensions and World Coordinate Positioning | No Information | No Information | 

2. - With Selection Mode: Face (<kbd> Number 3 </kbd>) activated, you can see the following display information:

| Solid | Sheet | Sketch (Region) |  
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Object Type, Object Dimensions, Object Sub-Type (Plane and Cylinder), Plane Degree, and World Coordinate Positioning | Object Type, Object Dimensions, Object Sub-Type (Plane and Cylinder), Plane Degree, and World Coordinate Positioning | No Information | 

3. - With Selection Mode: Edge (<kbd> Number 2 </kbd>) activated, you can see the following display information:

| Solid | Sheet | Sketch (Curve, Vertex, Control-Vertex, and Region) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |  
| Object Type, Object Dimensions, Object Sub-Type (Circle and Line), Line Degree, and World Coordinate Positioning | Object Type, Object Dimensions, Object Sub-Type (Circle and Line), Line Degree, and World Coordinate Positioning | Object Type, Object Dimensions, Object Sub-Type (Circle, Line, and Spline) Line Degree (Applicable on Lines and not Splines), and World Coordinate Positioning | 

4. - With Selection Mode: Point (<kbd> Number 1 </kbd>) activated, you can see the following display information:
