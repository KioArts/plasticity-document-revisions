# Detail Display 
The Detail Display window can be found at the bottom right of the screen (1), this window appears when an object is actively selected (2). It provides details such as:
        1. Selection count
        2. Object type and Sub-type
        3. Alignment and Degree information
        4. Dimension Property for Solids and curves
        5. Wordl coordinate positioning


 the selection count, object type and sub-type, alignment and degree information, dimension property for solids and curves, and world coordinate positions.

## Number Indicator
The number indicator is a feature that displays the count of selected objects in the detail display window, adjusting based on the current selection mode. It breaks down the selection by *object type* and *sub-type* count, for more detailed feedback.

## Object Type and Sub-type
In the Detail Display window, the object type and sub-type is shown based on your selection and the active selection mode. 

For example, if face selection mode **(1)** is activated only and you select several faces and a simple conic fillet shape on a cube **(2)**, it will display the type of selection with a number of *3 Faces* **(3)**, along with the sub-type breakdown of *2 Planes* and *1 Cylinder* **(4)**.

The following list contains information in regards to object type and sub-type in regards to the selection mode in active state:

## Allignment and Degree Information

The detail display window can display the degree between two selected objects and the allignment information in colrelation with two selected objects based on selection and type of selection mode. 

The Detail Display window shows both alignment and degree information between selected objects, based on the type and mode of selection. This information is useful for evaluating alignment between surfaces, edges, and other features on objects, whether in solid or sketch mode.

### Degree Information

Degree information is displayed based on the active selection mode when either a single object or two separate objects are selected and share a co-planar relationship.

For example, when the edge selection mode is active **(1)**, and two edges are selected on a single object **(2)**, the Detail Display window will show the corresponding degree information **(3)**.

### Allignment Information 

Alignment information is displayed based on the active selection mode when a single object or two separate objects are selected with a co-planar relationship.

Similarly, the Detail Display window can be used to acquire alignment information. If two edges are selected on a single object **(1)**, the alignment details will be displayed in the same manner **(2)**.

<h3 align="center">Allignment and Degree Information List</h3>

| Category | Point | Edge | Face | Solid | 
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ----- | 
| Allignment Information | Coincident | Parallel | Parallel | No Information Displayed | 
| Degree Information | No Information Displayed | Applicable | Applicable | No Information Displayed |

## Dimension Property

In the detail display window, there's a section to access dimension information based on selected objects and selection type. 

### Solid Dimension Property

Properties of solid objects include: 
        - **Volume**: Space taken up by the object. 
        - **Area:** Total outside area of the object.
        - **Perimeter:** Distance around the object's edges. 

![Solid Dimension Property](/img/solid-dimension-property.png)

### Curve Dimension Property

Properties of curve objects include: 
        - **Radius**: The distance from the center to any point on the outer edge of a sphere or circle.
        - **Circumference**: The distance around the boundary of a circle.
        - **Length**: The distance measured from one end to the other end of an object or space.

## World Coordinate Information

The woorld coordinate information displays the position of an object based on active selection selection mode.
