# Detail Display 
The Detail Display window can be found at the bottom right of the screen (1), this window appears when an object is actively selected (2). It provides details such as the selection count, object type and sub-type, alignment and degree information, dimension property for solids and curves, and world coordinate positions.

## Number Indicator
The number indicator is a feature that displays the count of selected objects in the detail display window, adjusting based on the current selection mode. It breaks down the selection by *object type* and *sub-type* count, for more detailed feedback.

## Object Type and Sub-type
In the Detail Display window, the object type and sub-type is shown based on your selection and the active selection mode. For example, if face selection mode **(1)** is activated only and you select several faces and a simple conic fillet shape on a cube **(2)**, it will display the type of selection with a number of *3 Faces* **(3)**, along with the sub-type breakdown of *2 Planes* and *1 Cylinder* **(4)**.
