# Detail Display 
The Detail Display window can be found at the bottom right of the screen (1), this window appears when an object is actively selected (2). It provides details such as the selection count, object type and sub-type, alignment and degree information, dimension property for solids and curves, and world coordinate positions.

## Number Indicator
The number indicator is a feature that displays the count of selected objects in the detail display window, adjusting based on the current selection mode. It breaks down the selection by *object type* and *sub-type* count, for more detailed feedback.

## Object Type and Sub-type
Object type in the detail display window, displays the object type based on the selection and type of selection mode. For example, if face selection mode (1) is activated and you select a few faces on a cube and a simple conic fillet shape (2), it will display you the type of selection you have (3 Faces) (3) and alongside its sub-type selection (2 Planes and 1 Cylinder) (4).
