### Installing Custom Matcaps

1. Prepare your custom matcaps files. Both EXR and PNG files need to be with identical names.

2. Locate the .plasticity directory on your OS (Operating System) and create a new folder labelled as "matcaps".

Windows - "X:/users/username/.plasticity"
Mac - "~/.plasticity"
Linux -"X:/usr/lib/plasticity/resources/app/.webpack/main/dot-plasticity"

3. Place your custom matcaps in the folder and restart Plasticity.
