### Installing Custom Matcaps

1. Prepare your custom matcaps files. Both EXR and PNG files need to be with identical names.

2. Locate the .plasticity directory on your OS (Operating System) and create a new folder labelled as "matcaps".

Windows - "X:/users/username/.plasticity"
Mac - "~/.plasticity"
Linux -"X:/usr/lib/plasticity/resources/app/.webpack/main/dot-plasticity"

3. Place your custom matcaps in the folder and restart Plasticity.

**Tip**     
- Ensure that both the EXR and PNG files are 512x512 pixels with a transparent background. The EXR file should also be in at least a 16-bit color range.
