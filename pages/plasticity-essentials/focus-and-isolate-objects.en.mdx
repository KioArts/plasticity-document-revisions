3. You can repeat this process through multiple layers of isolation.

An indicator at the top of the screen signifies that the Isolate mode is active. A number next to the indicator shows how many layers of isolation have been applied. For example, if "2 Isolated" is displayed, it indicates that you are in the second layer of isolation.

This command will reveal all previously isolated objects in the viewport. It will not return to the previous hierarchical isolation layer, so all objects will be visible instead.
