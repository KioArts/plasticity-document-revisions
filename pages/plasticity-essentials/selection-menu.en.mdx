# Detail Display 

## Selection Menu
The Detail Display window is located at the bottom right of the screen (1). In order to see the window, an object must be in active selection (2).  
The Detail Display window displays information such as number indicator of object selections, object type and sub-type, allignment and degree information, dimension property of objects (volume, area, perimeter) and curves (lenght, circumference and radius distance), and world coordinate positioning.

## Number Indicator
The number indicator is a feature that displays how many object selections you have on the detail display window. The display of objects is corelated with the selection mode - in other words, depending on what selection mode you are, it will display that type of information in the window. This feature displays different object types and their sub-type count.

## Object Type and Sub-type
Object type in the detail display window, displays the object type based on the selection and type of selection mode. For example, if face selection mode (1) is activated and you select a few faces on a cube and a simple conic fillet shape (2), it will display you the type of selection you have (3 Faces) (3) and alongside its sub-type selection (2 Planes and 1 Cylinder) (4).

## Allignment and Degree Information
- The detail display window can display the degree between two selected objects and the allignment information in colrelation with two selected objects based on selection and type of selection mode. 

Alignment and Degree information: 
1. Point - Coincident (Point Sketch)
2. Edge - Parallel (Solid and Sketch), Degree Information (Solid and Sketch)
3. Face - Parallel (Solid), Degree Information (Solid)
4. Solid - No Information
