# Selection Menu

## Selection Menu
The **Selection Menu** lives in the right-hand sidebar, on the last row. It offers the following information:

- **Number Indicator** – Shows how many objects are currently selected in the viewport.  
- **Object Type** – Displays the type of the selected item(s) according to the active selection mode.  
- **Sub-type** – Refines the object type, indicating exactly what has been selected.  
- **Alignment & Degree** – Reports the kind of alignment (e.g., parallel, perpendicular) and the angular degree between two objects.  
- **Dimension Property** – Provides geometric data such as volume, area, perimeter, length, circumference, and radius.  
- **World Positioning** – Gives the global coordinates of the entire object.

> **Note:** The menu only populates when at least one item is selected; otherwise it remains empty.

### Number Indicator
The **Number Indicator** shows how many objects are currently selected in the selection menu. Its count is driven by the **active selection mode**:

- The indicator always reports the total number of selected items and breaks that total down by object **type** and **sub-type**.  
- When you switch modes (e.g., from *Edge* selection to *Solid* selection) the new mode **adds** its selections to the existing set instead of replacing them.  
- Consequently, the Number Indicator updates to reflect the combined selection, showing the cumulative count for each object type/sub-type across all active modes.

### Object Type and Sub-type
Object type in the detail display window, displays the object type based on the selection and type of selection mode.

Used on Solid objects:
| Selection | Object Type | Sub-type |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Point Selection | - | - |
| Edge Selection | Edge | Line, Circle, Ellipse, Surface Curve, Intersection, and Spline |
| Face Selection | Face | Plane, Cone, Torus, Cylinder, Sphere, Spline, and Blend |
| Solid Selection | Solid and Sheet | No Information |

## Allignment and Degree Information
- The detail display window can display the degree between two selected objects and the allignment information in colrelation with two selected objects based on selection and type of selection mode. 

Alignment and Degree information: 
1. Point - Coincident (Point Sketch)
2. Edge - Parallel (Solid and Sketch), Degree Information (Solid and Sketch)
3. Face - Parallel (Solid), Degree Information (Solid)
4. Solid - No Information

### Allignment Information
