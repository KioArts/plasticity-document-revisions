## How to Import Reference Images

2. Click on **Import/Append** from the top-left menu.

5. If you have multiple reference images, grouping them together can make your work easier.

   - Eyeball icon: Switches temporary display/non-display.
   - Lightbulb icon: Can be set to always non-display. It will remain hidden even when using the select object display/non-display command.
   - Key icon: Can be set to unselectable. This prevents you from accidentally moving it.

## Setting Reference Images

You can set things like the transparency of reference images.

1. Click on the reference image to select it.

2. Press the <kbd>M</kbd> shortcut.

3. An image material setting dialog will be displayed.

   - **Depth**:
     - **Normal**: It is hidden by objects in front of the plane and hides objects behind.
     - **Front**: Always visible, regardless of other objects. (**Opacity** needs to be less than 1.)
     - **Behind**: (Not sure...)
   - **Opacity**: 
      - Specify transparency numerically. A checkbox must be checked.
   - **Culling**:
     - **Front only**: Only displayed when viewed from the front.
     - **Double sided**: Displayed whether viewed from the front or the back.

4. Confirm with OK in the dialog or by right-clicking.
