# Construction Planes

Curves are created on an active construction plane using sketch tools or commands. Construction planes can be the XY plane, YZ plane, XZ plane, or newly created ones.

## Using the XY Plane, YZ Plane, XZ Plane

- `Numeric Keypad 7` : Use the XY plane. This gives you a top-down view.
- `Numeric Keypad 3` : Use the YZ plane. This gives you a view from the right.
- `Numeric Keypad 1` : Use the XZ plane. This gives you a front-facing view.

## Creating a Construction Plane

You can create a construction plane to match the face of a solid or sheet. It can also be matched to the region of a sketch.

1. Select the face or region you want to make the construction plane.
2. Press `Space`.
3. You get a view perpendicular to the created construction plane.
4. The construction plane is created.

Also, you can create a construction plane to match the view visible in the work area.

1. Make the view you want for the construction plane.
2. Press `Ctrl`+`Space`.
3. The construction plane is created.

## Saving and Using Construction Planes

You can save the created construction plane for later use.

### Saving a Construction Plane

1. Click on **Temporary construction plane** at the top of the screen.
2. **Custom plane 0** is added to the right side of the screen.

### Using a Saved Construction Plane

1. Click on **Custom plane 0** on the right side of the screen.
2. The saved construction plane becomes active.

By double-clicking on **Custom plane 0**, the saved construction plane becomes active, and you get a view perpendicular to it.
