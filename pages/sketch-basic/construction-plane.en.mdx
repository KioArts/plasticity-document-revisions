## Construction Planes

Curves are created on the active construction plane. In addition to the XY, YZ, and XZ planes, you can create new construction planes.

### Using XY Plane, YZ Plane, XZ Plane

- `NumPad 7`: Use XY plane. This gives a top-down view.
- `NumPad 3`: Use YZ plane. This gives a right side view.
- `NumPad 1`: Use XZ plane. This gives a front view.

### Creating Construction Planes Aligned to a Surface

You can create a construction plane aligned with the face of a solid or sheet. [<YoutubeExternalIcon />](https://youtu.be/j0jyWmzZbpw)
