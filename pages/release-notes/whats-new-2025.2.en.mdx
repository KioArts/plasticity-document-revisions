# Plasticity 25.2 Release Notes  

Plasticity 25.2 introduces a wide array of enhancements and new features aimed at improving surface modeling workflows, enhancing usability, and streamlining the user experience. Below is a detailed overview of the updates:  

## 1. New Commands

### New Align Command
- **Align Surfaces**    
Align is a tool powered by xNURBS and allows you to align two surfaces (sheets) with consistent **G0** (positional), **G1** (tangential), or **G2** (curvature) continuity. You can select the target surface and adjust its degree, span, and other options to improve the quality of the transition. Note that this tool is available only with a Studio license.

## 2. Modeling Enhancements

### Square Command Enhancement
- **Individual Tension Settings**   
The Square command now allows setting individual tension values for each edge constraint.

[Learn more](/solid/square)

### Boolean Command Enhancement
- **New Operation: Region**     
A new **Region** option has been added to the Boolean command. It creates individual solids from enclosed regions formed by overlapping bodies.
- **New Advanced Options Panel**    
An **Advanced** section is now available beneath the main Boolean dialog. It includes options like **Target Material** and **Tool Material**, giving you more control over object assignment during Boolean operations.

[Learn more](/solid/boolean)

### Bridge Curve Enhancement
- **New Tension Gizmos**    
Tension Gizmos are now available for Bridge Curve and are precise in specifying the tension parametrization during the operation. This is intuitive to work with and streamlines the work.
- **Move Tension CVs**      
Tension for G1, G2, and G3 continuity can now be adjusted by directly moving the visible control-vertices (CVs) on the screen.
- **Curvature Combs**       
Curvature measurement is now optionally available during the Bridge Curve command under the **Analysis** menu. When the menu is open, curvature combs can be displayed to help evaluate the curve's shape in real time.

[Learn more](/sketch/bridge-curve)

### Fillet Shell Operation
- **Tension Parameter**     
When filleting a shell or edge, you can now adjust the Tension parameter to control how pronounced or subtle the fillet appears. This option is available across all shape types but the **Full** Shape option.

[Learn more](/solid/fillet-shell)

### Loft Enhancement
- **Simplify Planar Surfaces**        
The Loft command now includes a new **Simplify** option that controls how planar sections of lofted surfaces are created. This option is enabled by default and generates simplified trimmed patches for planar sections where the CV layout would otherwise be inconsistent. When Simplify is disabled, the loft generates intermediate geometry between profiles, resulting in a "tweening" effect that preserves a consistent CV layout across the entire surface.

[Learn more](/solid/loft)

### Isoparam Enhancement
- **Subdivide Surface**       
The Isoparam command now includes a **Subdivide** option, which allows you to split a surface while preserving its CV layout. When enabled, this option inserts an isoparametric line that divides the surface in half, and the resulting surfaces retain the same underlying CV structure as the original.

[Learn more](/solid/isoparam)

### Reverse Command Enhancement
The Reverse command can now handle multiple bodies at once, simultaneously reversing their direction (for curves) or normal direction (for sheets).

## 3. Improved Commands

### Duplicate Command
- **Duplicate Recursively**     
In the Outliner, it is now possible to duplicate group hierarchies recursively. Previously, only the parent group could be duplicated, and its child objects were not included in the duplication. With this update, all children within a group are now duplicated along with the parent.

[Learn more](/plasticity-essentials/outliner#group-objects)

### Unjoin Command
- **Unjoin Faces**  
The Unjoin command can now unjoin faces from multiple bodies simultaneously.

### Dimension Command
- **Line Segment**  
The Dimension command now supports modifying the dimension properties of individual line segments.

### Loft Command
- **Error Indicator**   
The Loft command now provides clearer error feedback by marking guide curves that fail to touch profiles with a red dot.

## 4. New features

### Selection Command
- **Invert Selection**   
The Invert Selection command now supports edges and faces.

### Selection Context Menu
- **Disambiguating Selections**         
When multiple objects overlap, a selection context menu helps clarify which object to select based on the current selection mode. To access this menu, hold <kbd>Ctrl + Shift</kbd> and left-click, or left-click while scrolling the mouse wheel.

[Learn more](/plasticity-essentials/selecting-objects)

### Point Selection Mode
- **CV Hull Selection**      
You can now select an entire row of CVs by hovering over the CV hull while holding <kbd>Alt</kbd>. The highlighted preview will indicate the direction of the loop selection before you click.

### Selection Panel
- **Rational or Nominal**     
The Selection panel now shows whether the selected surface is rational or nominal.
- **Parallel Distance**     
When planar faces are selected, the Selection panel now shows the distance between parallel surfaces.

### Extend Command
- **Extend Sheet**       
The command now has a dialog **Limit** option which will specify the sheet extention untill it reaches the inside or outside of a target body.

[Learn more](/solid/extend-sheet)

- **Extend Curve and Vertex**          
Both commands now optionally allow specifying a target to define the extension length of the curve.


### Untrim Command
- **Imprinted Edges**         
The Untrim command now has an option to retain imprinted edges after untrimming a surface.

[Learn more](/solid/untrim)

### Dialogues
- **Numeric Fields**       
Plasticity has always supported basic arithmetic operations by default. Now, the mathematical constant **Ï€ (pi)** is also supported in all numeric fields within dialogs.

| Type | Operation | Example |
| ----- | -------- | ------- |
| (+) | Addition | `35 + 12` (**Result:** 47.0) |
| (-) | Subtraction | `35 - 12` (**Result:** 23.0)|
| (*) | Multiplication | `35 * 12` (**Result:** 420.0) |
| (/) | Division | `35 / 12` (**Result:** 2.917)|
| (pi) | Mathematical Constant | `2 * pi * 3.15` (**Result:** 19.792) |

Additionally, numeric fields also support **unit conversion** based on the current units settings in Plasticity.

| Unit | Conversion to CM | Example |
| ----- | -------- | ------- |
| mm (Milimeter) | 1 mm = 0.1 cm | `5 + 2mm` (**Result:** 5.2 cm) |
| cm (Centimeter) | 1 cm = 1 cm | `5 + 2cm`  (**Result:** 7.0 cm)|
| m (Meter) | 1 m = 100 cm | `5 + 2m` (**Result:** 205.0 cm) |
| in (Inch)| 1 in = 2.54 cm | `5 + 2in` (**Result:** 10.08 cm)|
| ft (Foot) | 1 ft = 30.48 cm| `5 + 2ft` (**Result:** 65.96 cm) |

### Cut Command
- **Extend**       
The Cut Command now includes an **Extend** option for curve cutters. If the curve is too short to fully cut the target objects, this option will extend its length to ensure a complete cut.

[Learn more](/sketch/cut-curve)

### Sweep, Pipe, and Curve Array
- **Extend Methods**       
Sweep, Pipe, and Curve Array now include new **Extend Methods** - *Sweep: Distance, Pipe: Distance, and Curve Array: Extend and Method* - which allow you to control how much to extend or retract the sweep body, pipe body, or duplicates along the path curves. 

Learn More: [Sweep](/solid/sweep), [Pipe](/solid/pipe), [Curve Array](/common/curve-array)

### Imprint and Project Body
Both commands now support multiple tool bodies simultaneously, instead of handling only tool pairs individually.

## 5. Improved features

### Camera
- **FOV Change**       
The default field of view (FOV) for the perspective camera has been changed from **50** to **35**. This adjustment addresses reported clipping issues, which are often caused by unit scale or very small scene tolerances. If clipping still occurs, try lowering the FOV further to improve visibility.

### Interface
- **Visual Zoom**     
A new **Zoom Factor** option has been added in the Appearance section, allowing you to increase the interface's visual zoom level.

### Toolbar
The toolbar now remembers its viewport side between sessions and after restarting.

### Select All Command
Now skips locked items in the Outliner during selection.

### Assets
The Assets menu now displays the material catalog with searchable previews and filters.

## 6. Shading Improvement
Plasticity now offers enhanced shading features that make it easier and more effective to visualize your work. Below are the key improvements and details:

### Physical Materials  
Plasticity now includes a collection of 34 physical materials accessible from the Assets panel. These materials become visible when **Render Mode** is enabled.

[Learn more](/plasticity-essentials/assets#physical-materials)

### Render Mode
- **HDRI**  
Choose from a selection of HDRIs and rotate them for custom lighting and reflections.
- **Ground-Plane Shadow**   
Shadows are now projected onto the ground plane, showing the silhouette of your object for better visual context.
- **Ambient Occlusion**     
Ambient Occlusion is always enabled in Render Mode and can be configured under Preferences > Appearance.

[Learn more](/plasticity-essentials/render-mode)

### Shader Mode
- **Ambient Occlusion**        
You can enable Ambient Occlusion even when Render Mode is off via Preferences > Performance. Note: This is recommended for machines with high-end GPUs (e.g., RTX 3060 or higher).
- **Topology Shader**    
A new shader that displays a wireframe look on your model, ideal for imported meshes and reverse engineering. It helps analyze complex organic shapes with intricate curves and deformations that might be hard to see with other shaders.
- **Normal Checker**    
This shader shows surface normal direction by coloring surfaces blue if facing outward and red if inward. It works with the Reverse command to help fix normal orientation quickly.
