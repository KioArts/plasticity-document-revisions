# Plasticity 25.1 Release Notes  

Plasticity 25.1 introduces a wide array of enhancements and new features aimed at improving surface modeling workflows, enhancing usability, and streamlining the user experience. Below is a detailed overview of the updates:  

## 1. New Commands

For Material - Allows you to duplicate and edit the materials for the selected objects. 

Measure Continuity - Allows you to take pairs of edges and measures G0/G1/G2 continuity while the command is running.

Align Command - A command that allows you to align two surfaces to have G0/G1/G2 continuity. Further reading, check here. (you can now change degree/Spans of surface.)

Unlock All - Unlocks all locked objects and groups in the outliner.

Region Command - A command similar to boolean command, identifies fully enclosed regions given a collection of bodies.

## New features

CV Hull Selection - Select a row of CVs by selecting the CV hull with Alt button.
Boolean Command - Now has a dialog "Advance" section wih "material side" options

Extend Sheet, Extend Curve and Vertex, and Push Face Commands - Now have a dialogie "limit" option for accepting a target.

## 2. Improved Commands

Duplicate Command - Is not supported to allow you to duplicate groups in which will duplicate children recursively. Previously, only the external group could've been duplicated, meaning what has been inside the group wouldn't be affected.

Cut Command - Now has an option to "Extend" the cutting curve in case it is too short to go fully through the object

Square Command - Now allows measuring G1/G2 continuity. Previously this has been supported only for G0 continuity.

Reverse Command - Can now reverse multiple bodies simultaneously

Export STEP / SAT Commands - Commands are now accessible from command panel

Select All Command - Now ignores locked items in the outliner

Imprint Body and Project Body - Now accept multiple tool bodies

Unjoin Command - Can now unjoin faces from multiple bodies simultaneously

Loft Command - Now has better error messages for indicating where guide curves fail to touch profiles with a red dot.

Isoparam Command - Now has a dialogue window, displaying all options.

## Improved features

Toolbar - Toolbar now remembers which side on viewport on next session or restart.

## 2. Modeling Enhancements

Path Curves - Tools such as Sweep/Pipe/Curve array can now extend and trim the path curves.



## Shading Improvement

Rendermode - Introduces a function that allows you to choose HDRIs and the option to rotate them.

Ambient Occlusion - A new feature has been introduced in rendermode. This allows you to tweak various settings in the render mode panel (however, not saved with the file). 

HDRIs - A few new HDRIs have been added.

**Material Editing from Assets Panel - In render mode, it is possible to tweak the default material used from the Assets Panel. However, this is not yet saved with the file.

Assets Panel - Introducing 20 physical materials in the Assets Panel - includes material presets for metal, marble, wood, and more. Physical materials only work when render mode is on. They differ a bit from default materials in Plasticity with the only difference of editing properties.

Ground-Plane Shadow - In Render Mode, a new feature has been introduced to display a shadow on the ground plane. This shows the sillhouette of the overall object, projected downwards on the plane.

Camera - Default perspective camera FOV has changed from 50 to 35. 

Zebra Shader - Has been slightly improved for visual usability. Now introduces a feature where you can change number of bands in options in the shader panel.

Preferences 

- Option to increase interface visual zoom level in Appearance section.
- Ambient Occlusion - Settings for AO are now located in Plasticity's settings - Appearance. A new option in Preferences to turn on ambient occlusion in shader mode.
