# Plasticity 25.3 Release Notes  

Plasticity 25.3 delivers a comprehensive set of updates aimed at streamlining surface modelling, precision editing, and overall workflow efficiency. The update adds live instance creation and realization, radial measurement and ellipse tools, automatic pivot adjustments, and real time curvature and continuity feedback, while also refining array, mirror, and sweep functionalities and workflows. 

Users can benefit from the edge manipulation on cylindrical and conical surfaces, drag and drop material handling, faster navigation, new OBJ export options for topology control and expanded language support. Below is a detailed overview of the updates:  

## 1. New Commands 

### Create Instance Command
- **Instance Workflow**     
The *Create Instance* command creates live instances of Solids, Sheets, Curves, and Groups referencing the original geometry. This approach avoids duplicating mesh data, keeps models lightweight, and ensures that any modification to the parent object propagates automatically to all its instances.

### Realize Instances Command
- **From Instance to Real Body**        
The *Realize Instances* command converts selected instance objects into editable real bodies, giving you full control over the resulting geometry in Plasticity.

### Publish to Plasticity Share Command
- **Upload and Share (.plasticity) Documents Online**    
*Publish to Plasticity Share* is a new export command that lets you share a web link to your work. It uploads only the mesh data (no CAD geometry or source files), so the shared file can only be previewed and cannot be downloaded, keeping cloud storage usage minimal. This feature is ideal for quickly showing visualizations without exposing the original project files.

### Measure Radius Command
- **Radial Measurement**  
  A dedicated *Measure Radius* command for objects with radial geometry, applicable to cylinders, cones, and other similarly shaped elements.

### Snap to Grid
- **Scale Gizmo**   
 Incremental snapping is now respected when Grid Snapping is enabled while using the Scale tool.

### Snap Point
- **Spherical faces**       
 Spherical faces now include a **Center** snap point.

### Move Tool
- **Solid and Sheet Edge Manipulation**   
 Moving an edge of a solid or sheet body now supports circular edges on cylindrical and conical faces. The operation preserves the analytical geometry of those faces. You can manipulate both interior and exterior surface edges, provided the adjacent faces are planar, cylindrical, or conical and the moving edge is a line or a circle.

### Pivot Point
- **Automatic Pivot Adjustment**    
Automatically orients the pivot point along the surface normal at the location where a primitive or sketch object is first placed. The tools affected are listed below.

| Primitive Tools | Sketching Tools |
| ---- | ---- |
|[Corner Box](/tool/corner-box) | [Corner Rectangle](/tool/corner-rectangle) |

| - | [Regular Polygon](/tool/polygon) |
| - | [Ellipse](/tool/ellipse) |

## 3. General Improvements

### Mouse Navigation 
- **Navigation**    
 The mousewheel zoom has been tweaked to be faster when navigating through scenes. This adjustment makes it easier to zoom in on details, especially when working with large scenes.

### Performance
- **Curves** - Optimizations have been made for scenes with lots of intersecting curves. 
- **Snap to OBJ Files** - Snapping to OBJ files has been optimized and responsive when snapping to face and vertex.

### Localization
- **New Languages**  
Plasticity now allows you to configure up to 9 preferred languages in the **Preferences** section.

| Language | Note |
| -------- | ---- |

<Center width="230px">
![New Material](/img/2025.3-new-physical-material.png)
</Center>

- **Highlight Indicator**       
  Hovering over a material in the Assets tab highlights every item that uses that material in the viewport.  

<Center width="600px"
border ="1px solid #221458ff"
borderRadius="8px">
![Assets Tab Highlight Indicator](/img/2025.3-highlight-indicator.gif)
</Center>

- **Drag and Drop Material**    
 You can now drag a physical material from the Material Library in the Assets menu directly onto an object in the viewport. It's a feature that wasn't available in earlier versions of Plasticity.  

<Center width="600px"

</Center>

[Learn More](/plasticity-essentials/assets)

### Export OBJ
- **Remove Small Features**   
 This option lets you define a range that will remove surface details based on the numerical value. It's especially handy for high-poly to low-poly workflows, where texture baking and topology optimisation is involved, or any general mesh cleanup.

<Center width="600px"
border ="1px solid #221458ff"
borderRadius="8px">
![Remove Small Features](/img/2025.3-remove-small-features.gif)
</Center>

- **Simplify Radial Surfaces**    
When possible, this feature simplifies radial geometry and aligns edge flow so that edges remain continuous rather than broken. It works best on relatively simple shapes; complex geometry may not always achieve perfect results.

<Center width="600px"
border ="1px solid #221458ff"
borderRadius="8px">
![Simplify Radial Surfaces](/img/2025.3-simplify-radial-surface-export.gif)
</Center>

- **Ngon optimization**   
If the topology mode is set to *Ngons*, enabling **Convex Ngons Only** prevents the creation of concave ngons. This helps when exporting to applications such as RizomUV, 3ds Max, etc., which struggle with concave ngons and can produce incorrect normals or shading artifacts. While the export may contain slightly more ngons, the resulting shading and overall topology quality are more reliable.

border ="1px solid #221458ff"
borderRadius="8px">
![Ngon Shading Optimization](/img/2025.3-ngon-shading-optimization-export.svg)
</Center>

- **Export Empty and Instances**    
The *Export OBJ* command now supports exporting empty meshes (e.g., STL, FBX, OBJ) and instances. Instances that haven't been converted into real bodies are included in the export. If nothing is selected, everything visible in the viewport will be exported.

## 5. Improved Features

### Viewport
- **Drag and Drop Material**    
 You can now drag a material dot from the Outliner straight into the viewport. This provides an alternative to the traditional method of dragging a material dot onto another object while staying inside the Outliner.

### Mesh Objects
- **Origin Pivot**    
You can now manipulate mesh (e.g., STL, FBX, OBJ) objects' pivot points and save their location as desired.

### Preferences
- **Improved Faceting Setting**   
Change faceting density without restarting Plasticity. This setting applies to new bodies and edits; existing bodies will not be refaceted.

## 6. Improved Commands

### Array Commands
- **Array Instances, Meshes and Images**    
It is now possible to array instances, meshes and images in Plasticity. Possible array commands are listed below.

| Array Commands | 
| ---- | 
|[Curve Array](/common/curve-array) | 
|[Radial Array](/common/radial-array) | 
|[Rectangular Array](/common/rectangular-array) | 

- **Make Instances Option**   
Array commands now have an included option named as "Make Instances".

Learn more - [Curve Array](/common/curve-array), [Radial Array](/common/radial-array), [Rectangular Array](/common/rectangular-array)

### Transform
- **Instances and Meshes**    
Mirror command can mirror meshes (e.g., STL, FBX, OBJ) and instances.

- **Mirror Scale on Instances**   
Applying a scale value of -1 on any axis mirrors the instance along that axis and is fully supported for instance objects.

### Measure Curvature
- **New Command Name**    
Measure Curvature has been renamed to *Toggle Curvature*. As the name suggests, this command now allows you to toggle the curvature display on and off directly from the outliner under Measurements -> Curvature.

- **New Panel Menu**    
*Toggle Curvature* now features a dedicated panel menu located in the right side panel. Here you can directly adjust the comb size and control visibility using the "Comb scale" option.

<Center width="270px">
![New Panel Menu](/img/2025.3-curvature-panel.svg)
</Center>

- **Live Feedback**   
You can now manipulate curves and edges in real time while *Toggle Curvature* is active, providing immediate visual feedback as you model. This makes it easier to optimize curvature on a Curve and Solid when working with the [Slide command](/solid/slide).

<Center width="400px"
border ="1px solid #221458ff"
borderRadius="8px">
![Control Curvature Real Time](/img/2025.3-curvature-manipulation-example.gif)
</Center>

- **File Compatibility**    
Files created in version 25.3 can be opened in earlier versions of Plasticity. Any existing curvature measurements will be automatically removed rather than triggering an error.

[Learn More](/sketch/measure-curvature)

### Measure Continuity 
- **New Panel Menu**    
Measure Continuity now features a dedicated panel menu located in the right side panel. You can adjust the comb size for G0/G1/G2 using their respective "Scale" controls and toggle the display of numerical measurement values with "Show maxes".

<Center width="270px">
![New Panel Menu](/img/2025.3-curvature-panel.svg)
</Center>

- **Live Feedback**   
Similar to *Toggle Curvature*, you can now manipulate curves and edges in real time while *Measure Continuity* is active, providing visual feedback as continuity values update.

<Center width="400px"

### Section Analysis
- **Mesh Objects**   
With the Section Analysis command, you can create a virtual slice through meshes (e.g., STL, FBX, OBJ).

[Learn More](/common/section-analysis)


### Sweep 
- **Advanced Options**    
Sweep now includes advanced corner type options: Mitre and Round. When sweeping a curve along a guide with outward corners, Mitre produces sharp turns while Round creates rounded external corners. Note that Round works best with 90-degree corners.
