# Plasticity 25.2 Release Notes  

Plasticity 25.3 introduces a wide array of enhancements and new features aimed at improving surface modeling, enhancing usability, and streamlining operations. Below is a detailed overview of the updates:  

## 1. New Commands

### New Instance Command
- **Instance Solids, Sheets, Curves, and Groups**     
The new *Instance* command creates live instances of Solids, Sheets, Curves, and Groups by referencing the original geometry. This approach avoids duplicating mesh data, keeps models lightweight, and ensures that any modification to the parent object propagates automatically to all its instances.

### New Realize instances Command
- **From Instance to Real Body**        
The *Realize Instances* command converts selected instance objects into editable real bodies, giving you full control over the resulting geometry in Plasticity.

### New Publish to Web Command
- **Upload and Share (.plasticity) Document Online**    
Publish to Web is a new export command that lets you share a web link to your *.plasticity* work. It uploads only the mesh data (no CAD geometry or source files), so the shared file can be only previewed and cannot be downloaded, keeping cloud storage usage minimal. This feature is ideal for quickly showing visualizations without exposing the original project files.

### New Measurement Command
- **Radial Measurement**    
Specific measurement command dedicated for objects with radial geometry - applies for cylinder, conic, and more.

## 2. Modeling Enhancements

### General Optimizations
- **Curves** - Optimizations have been made for scenes with lots of intersecting curves. 
- **Snap to OBJ Files** - Snapping to OBJ files has been optimized and responsive when snapping to face and vertex.

### Measurement and Curve Appearance Update
- **Measurements** - Arrows are now displayed at the ends of dimension lines.  

<Center width="500px">

- **Curves** - Rendered with a thinner stroke, which reduces visual clutter in dense scenes.

### Mouse Navigation 
- **Navigation**
 The mousewheel zoom has been tweaked to be faster when navigating through scenes. This adjustment makes it easier to zoom in on details, especially when working with large scenes.

### Snap To Grid
- **Scale Gizmo**   
 Incremental snapping is now respected when Grid Snapping is enabled while using the Scale tool.

### Move Tool
- **Solid and Sheet Edge Manipulation**   
 Moving an edge of a solid or sheet body now supports circular edges on cylindrical and conical faces. The operation preserves the analytical geometry of those faces. You can manipulate both interior and exterior surface edges, provided the adjacent faces are planar, cylindrical, or conical and the moving edge is a line or a circle.

### Export and Import ---
- **Export SVG**    
 it is now possible to export SVg from Plasticity. This is possible when curves are visible and are placed on flat plane on the Z axis plane.

### Render Mode
- **New Default HDRI**      
 New default environment HDRI has been added to the collection in [Render Mode](/plasticity-essentials/render-mode) and is available when it is enabled.

### Viewport
- **Drag and Drop Material**    
 You can now drag a material dot from the Outliner straight into the viewport. This provides an alternative to the traditional method of dragging a material dot onto another object while staying inside the Outliner.

### Duplicate Command
- **Duplicate Recursively**     
In the Outliner, it is now possible to duplicate group hierarchies recursively. Previously, only the parent group could be duplicated, and its child objects were not included in the duplication. With this update, all children within a group are now duplicated along with the parent.
