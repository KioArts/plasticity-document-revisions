# Plasticity 25.2 Release Notes  

Plasticity 25.3 introduces a wide array of enhancements and new features aimed at improving surface modeling, enhancing usability, and streamlining operations. Below is a detailed overview of the updates:  

## 1. New Commands

### New Instance Command
- **Instance Solids, Sheets, Curves, and Groups**     
The new *Instance* command creates live instances of Solids, Sheets, Curves, and Groups by referencing the original geometry. This approach avoids duplicating mesh data, keeps models lightweight, and ensures that any modification to the parent object propagates automatically to all its instances.

### New Realize instances Command
- **From Instance to Real Body**        
The *Realize Instances* command converts selected instance objects into editable real bodies, giving you full control over the resulting geometry in Plasticity.

### New Publish to Web Command
- **Upload and Share (.plasticity) Document Online**    
Publish to Web is a new export command that lets you share a web link to your *.plasticity* work. It uploads only the mesh data (no CAD geometry or source files), so the shared file can be only previewed and cannot be downloaded, keeping cloud storage usage minimal. This feature is ideal for quickly showing visualizations without exposing the original project files.

### New Measurement Command
- **Radial Measurement**    
Specific measurement command dedicated for objects with radial geometry - applies for cylinder, conic, and more.

### New Ellipse Tool ---
- **Ellipse Tool**    
A new Ellipse tool has been introduce in Plasticity. This gives a more precise control on building an ellipse. Previously, an ellipse could've been made by just making a regular circle and using the Scale tool to scale either one side or using the freestyle option of scale.

## 2. Modeling Enhancements

### General Optimizations
- **Curves** - Optimizations have been made for scenes with lots of intersecting curves. 
- **Snap to OBJ Files** - Snapping to OBJ files has been optimized and responsive when snapping to face and vertex.

### Measurement and Curve Appearance Update
- **Measurements** - Arrows are now displayed at the ends of dimension lines.  

<Center width="500px">
![Measurement Apperance Change](/img/2025.3-measurement-changes-example.svg)
</Center>

- **Curves** - Rendered with a thinner stroke, which reduces visual clutter in dense scenes.

</Center>

### Mouse Navigation 
- **Navigation**
 The mousewheel zoom has been tweaked to be faster when navigating through scenes. This adjustment makes it easier to zoom in on details, especially when working with large scenes.

### Snap To Grid
- **Scale Gizmo**   
 Incremental snapping is now respected when Grid Snapping is enabled while using the Scale tool.

### Move Tool
- **Solid and Sheet Edge Manipulation**   
 Moving an edge of a solid or sheet body now supports circular edges on cylindrical and conical faces. The operation preserves the analytical geometry of those faces. You can manipulate both interior and exterior surface edges, provided the adjacent faces are planar, cylindrical, or conical and the moving edge is a line or a circle.

### Export OBJ
- **Remove Small Features**   
 This option lets you define a range that will remove surface details based on the numerical value. It's especially handy for high-poly to low-poly workflows, where texture baking and topology optimisation is involved, or any general mesh cleanup.

borderRadius="8px">
![Remove Small Features](/img/2025.3-remove-small-features.gif)
</Center>

- **Simplify Radial Surfaces**    
When possible, this feature simplifies radial geometry and aligns edge flow so that edges remain continuous rather than broken. It works best on relatively simple shapes; complex geometry may not always achieve perfect results.

border ="1px solid #221458ff"
borderRadius="8px">
![Simplify Radial Surfaces](/img/2025.3-simplify-radial-surface-export.gif)
</Center>

- **Ngon optimization**   
If the topology mode is set to *Ngons*, enabling **Convex Ngons Only** prevents the creation of concave ngons. This helps when exporting to applications such as RizomUV, 3ds Max, etc., which struggle with concave ngons and can produce incorrect normals or shading artifacts. While the export may contain slightly more ngons, the resulting shading and overall topology quality are more reliable.

border ="1px solid #221458ff"
borderRadius="8px">
![Ngon Shading Optimization](/img/2025.3-ngon-shading-optimization-export.svg)
</Center>

- **Export Empty and Instances**    
The *Export OBJ* command now supports exporting empty meshes (e.g., STL, FBX, OBJ) and instances. Instances that haven't been converted into real bodies are included in the export. If nothing is selected, everything visible in the viewport will be exported.

### Mirror Command 
- **Instances and Meshes**
Mirror command can mirror meshes (e.g., STL, FBX, OBJ) and instances.

### Scale Command
- **Mirror Scale on Instances**

Applying a scale value of -1 on any axis mirrors the instance along that axis and is fully supported for instance objects.

### Measure Curvature
- **New Command Name**    
Measure Curvature has been renamed to *Toggle Curvature*. As the name suggests, this command now allows you to toggle the curvature display on and off directly from the outliner under Measurements -> Curvature.

- **New Panel Menu**    
*Toggle Curvature* now features a dedicated panel menu located in the right side panel. Here you can directly adjust the comb size and control visibility using the "Comb scale" option.

<Center>
![New Panel Menu](/img/2025.3-curvature-panel.svg)
</Center>

- **Live Feedback**   
You can now manipulate curves and edges in real time while *Toggle Curvature* is active, providing immediate visual feedback as you model. This makes it easier to optimize curvature on a Curve and Solid when working with the [Slide command](/solid/slide).
