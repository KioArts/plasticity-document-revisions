# Update Information Version 2025.1

Release date: February 15, 2025

# Plasticity 25.1 Release Notes  

Plasticity 25.1 introduces a wide array of enhancements and new features aimed at improving surface modeling workflows, enhancing usability, and streamlining the user experience. Below is a detailed overview of the updates:  

## 1. New Commands

### New Slide Command  
- **CV Sliding**  
Users can move control vertices (CVs) along the surface hull, guided by the CV's direction, allowing for fine-tuned adjustments and enhancing precision modeling for surface refinement.    

For more information, click [here](/sketch/slide).

### New Section Analysis Command
- **Section Analysis**  
Section Analysis is a feature that allows users to slice through their 3D model to reveal its interior structure. This helps identify whether internal components are properly aligned or interfering with each other. It is especially useful for architectural, engineering, and design visualization.    

For more information, click [here](/common/section-analysis).

## 2. Modeling Enhancements

### Square Command Updates
- **New "Free" Option**  
Trades G0 precision for higher surface quality. For more information on this feature, click [here](/solid/square).
- **Improved Functionality**  
The command now supports selecting one or more faces to act as a rough *RefitTrim* or *TrimConvert* tool. It can also be executed without any preselected geometry.  
- **"Adjacent" Boundary Option**  
Introduces a new boundary condition that uses adjacent trimmed edges for creating smoother transitions.
- **"Tension" Feature**  
Introduces a new feature enabling users to adjust the tension of the tangency along surface edges, similar to tools used in Lofting and Bridging workflows. It provides better control over shaping surfaces.

For more information, click [here](/solid/square).

### Xnurbs Enhancements
- **"Adjacent" Boundary Option**  
Introduces a new boundary condition that uses adjacent trimmed edges for creating smoother transitions.  
- **"Tension" Feature**  
Introduces a new feature enabling users to adjust the tension of the tangency along surface edges, similar to tools used in Lofting and Bridging workflows. It provides better control over shaping surfaces.   

For more information, click [here](/solid/xnurbs).

### CV Move Editing 
- **Proportional and Mirrored Transformations**  
Users can now edit surface CVs proportionally and with mirrored transformations.    

For more information, click [here](/common/move#move-control-point).

### Raise Degree Command Enhancement
- The [**Raise Degree**](/solid/raise-surface-degree) command can now be executed when a surface CV is selected.  

### Toggle Points Command Update  
- The [**Toggle Points**](/sketch/toggle-points) command is now accessible when a curve CV is selected. 

## 3. Sketching and Curve Tools

### Curve Rebuild Enhancement  
- **Weight Option**  
The Rebuild command now includes a new option "Weight" when using explicit control to rebuild a curve.

### Snapping Enhancements  
- **New Tangent Snapping**  
Introducing **Tan/Tan** snapping for ellipses and general splines. 
- **New "Control Point" Snap Option**   
A new "Control point" snap is now available in the subpanel.

### Sketching Enhancements
- **Region Deletion Behavior**  
Deleting regions now automatically removes the curves that bound them, making manual cleanup easier and faster.  

## 4. Transformation Tools

### Transform Command Enhancements
- **Stored Transform Pivots**  
Transformation pivots are now saved with objects when using Move, Rotate and Scale commands. 
- **Customizable Transform Options**  
Users can specify the transform orientation (**Local**, **CPlane**, **World**) and pivot point (**Bounding Box**, **Median**, **Last Selected**), offering greater flexibility in transformations. 

For more information, click [here](/common/move) for Move, [here](/common/move) for Rotate and [here](/common/move) for Scale.
  
## 5. Surface Tools

### Sheet Extension Enhancements
- **New "Natural" Mode**  
Introducing a new **"Natural"** mode for extending sheets.
- **Surface Extension**     
Surface extension modes can now be toggled using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key.  

For more information, click [here](/solid/extend-sheet).

### Construction Plane Enhancements 
Users can now create a construction plane that passes through two selected points and aligns with the camera view. Ideal for planarizing a hull while maintaining alignment with the view direction. 

For more information, click [here](/plasticity-essentials/construction-plane#4-creating-a-construction-plane-from-multiple-points).

### Bridge Surface
- **New "Tension" Option**  
New **"Tension"** option now available for Bridge Surface command. Refer [here](/solid/bridge-surface).

### Trimming Optimization
Trimming operations for densely packed 2D sketches, such as hexagonal grids, have been optimized. 

## 6. Selection and Conversion

### Selection Conversion Enhancements
- **New Conversion Options**  
Vertices and control vertices (CVs) can now be converted to points and vice versa, while regions can be converted to their bounding curves.

For more information, click [here](/plasticity-essentials/selecting-objects#select-from-the-currently-selected-objects) for Selection Conversion.

## 7. User Interface and Usability Enhancements

### New User Interface Design
- Revamped with a modern and streamlined appearance while retaining functional aspects from earlier versions.
- Improved feature placement and enhanced usability to optimize workflows.
- This update lays the groundwork for future UI enhancements.

### Navigation and Interaction Improvements   
- **Recent Files** - Drag and drop files/items from the Recent Files list into the viewport for quick import.
- **Sidebar** - Panels on the right side now function as menus.
- **Sidebar** - A toggle button has been introduced to show or hide the sidebar.
- **Viewport Cube** - Repeatedly clicking the cube will flip front/back and left/right, etc.

### Visual and Feedback Enhancements     
- **Focus Point Orbiting** - Displays a focus point indicator (dot) when orbiting the view.
- **Progress Indicator** - Opening large files will now show a simple progress indicator.
- **Tooltips** - Added tooltip images to Offset, Bridge Surface, Extend Sheet and Curve, XNurbs, Square, Imprint Curve, Project Curve, Export OBJ, Sweep, and Fillet tools to showcase the functions of certain options.

### Preferences and Customization
