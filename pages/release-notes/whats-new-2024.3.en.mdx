# Update Information Version 2025.1

Release date: February 15, 2025

# Plasticity 25.1 Release Notes  

Plasticity 25.1 introduces a wide array of enhancements and new features aimed at improving surface modeling workflows, enhancing usability, and streamlining the user experience. Below is a detailed overview of the updates:  

## 1. New Commands

### New Slide Command  
- **CV Sliding**  
Users can move control vertices (CVs) along the surface hull, guided by the CV's direction, allowing for fine-tuned adjustments and enhancing precision modeling for surface refinement.    

For more information, click [here](/sketch/slide).

### New Section Analysis Command
- **Section Analysis**  
Section Analysis is a feature that allows users to slice through their 3D model to reveal its interior structure. This helps identify whether internal components are properly aligned or interfering with each other. It is especially useful for architectural, engineering, and design visualization.    

For more information, click [here](/common/section-analysis).

## 2. Modeling Enhancements

### Square Command Updates
- **New "Free" Option**  
Trades G0 precision for higher surface quality. For more information on this feature, click [here](/solid/square).
- **Improved Functionality**  
The command now supports selecting one or more faces to act as a rough *RefitTrim* or *TrimConvert* tool. It can also be executed without any preselected geometry.  

For more information, click [here](/solid/square).

### Xnurbs and Square Enhancements
- **"Adjacent" Boundary Option**  
Introduces a new boundary condition that uses adjacent trimmed edges for creating smoother transitions.  
- **"Tension" Feature**  
Provides control over the tangent direction derivative along surface edges, similar to features in lofting or bridging workflows.  
Allows alternation or amplification of surface shapes by adjusting the magnitude of tangency, giving users more creative control over surface continuity.   

For more information on this feature, click [here](/solid/square) for Square Command or [here](/solid/xnurb) for XNurbs Command.

### CV Move Editing 
- **Proportional and Mirrored Transformations**  
Users can now edit surface CVs proportionally and with mirrored transformations.    

For more information, click [here](/common/move#move-control-point).

### Raise Degree Command Enhancement
- The [**Raise Degree**](/solid/raise-surface-degree) command can now be executed when a surface CV is selected, simplifying degree adjustments during modeling.  

### Toggle Points Command Update  
- The [**Toggle Points**](/sketch/toggle-points) command is now accessible when a curve CV is selected, improving workflow consistency between curve and surface editing.  

## 3. Sketching and Curve Tools

### Curve Rebuild Enhancement  
- **Deviation Plot**  
The Rebuild command now includes a Deviation Plot when using explicit control to rebuild a curve.

### Snapping Enhancements  
- **New Tangent Snapping**  
Introducing **Tan/Tan** snapping for ellipses and general splines, improving precision when aligning curves. 
- **New Control Point Snap Option**   
Object snaps sub panel now has "Control point" option

### Sketching Enhancements
- **Region Deletion Behavior**  
Deleting regions now automatically removes the curves that bound them, making manual cleanup easier and faster.  

## 4. Transformation Tools

### Transform Command Enhancements
- **Stored Transform Pivots**  
Transformation pivots are now saved with bodies, making move commands more consistent and intuitive.  
- **Customizable Transform Options**  
Users can specify the transform orientation (**Local**, **CPlane**, **World**) and pivot point (**Bounding Box**, **Median**, **Last Selected**), offering greater flexibility in transformations. 

For more information, click [here](/common/move).
  
## 5. Surface Tools

### Sheet Extension Enhancements
- **New "Natural" Mode**  
Introducing a new **Natural** mode for extending sheets along natural or isoparametric edges.
- **Surface Extension**     
Surface extension modes can now be toggled using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key.  

For more information, click [here](/common/move).

### Construction Plane Enhancements 
- **Dynamic Plane Creation**  
Users can now create a construction plane that passes through two selected points and aligns with the camera view.
Ideal for planarizing a hull while maintaining alignment with the view direction, making the process faster and more intuitive. 

For more information, click [here](/plasticity-essentials/construction-plane).

### Bridge Surface
- **New "Tension" Option**  
New Tension option now available for Bridge Surface command. Refer [here](/solid/bridge-surface).

### Trimming Optimization
Trimming operations for densely packed 2D sketches, such as hexagonal grids, have been optimized for improved speed and efficiency. 

## 6. Selection and Conversion

### Selection Conversion Enhancements
- **New Conversion Options**  
Vertices and control vertices (CVs) can now be converted to points and vice versa, while regions can be converted to their bounding curves.

Refer [here](/plasticity-essentials/selecting-objects#select-from-the-currently-selected-objects) for Selection Conversion.

## 7. User Interface and Usability Enhancements

### New User Interface Design
- Revamped with a modern and streamlined appearance while retaining functional aspects from earlier versions.
- Improved feature placement and enhanced usability to optimize workflows.
- This update lays the groundwork for future UI enhancements.

## 9. Outliner X
- **Construction Planes** 
Planes in outliner have a rightclick context menu with "make active cplane" (set construction plane/ navigate to construction plane)

## 12. Spacemouse Support
