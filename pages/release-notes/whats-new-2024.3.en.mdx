# Update Information Version 2024.2

Release date: September 5, 2024

# Plasticity 24.3 Release Notes  

Plasticity 24.3 introduces a wide array of enhancements and new features aimed at improving surface modeling workflows, enhancing usability, and streamlining the user experience. Below is a detailed overview of the updates:  

## 1. New Commands

### New Slide Command  
- **CV Sliding**  
Users can move control vertices (CVs) along the surface hull, guided by the CV's direction, allowing for fine-tuned adjustments and enhancing precision modeling for surface refinement. Refer [here](/sketch/slide).

## 2. Modeling Enhancements

### Square Command Updates
- **New "Free" Option**  
  - Trades G0 precision for higher surface quality. For more information on this feature, click [here](/solid/square).
- **Improved Functionality**  
  - The command now supports selecting one or more faces to act as a rough `RefitTrim` or `TrimConvert` tool. It can also be executed without any preselected geometry.  

### Xnurbs/Square Enhancements
- **"Adjacent" Boundary Option**  
  - Introduces a new boundary condition that uses adjacent trimmed edges for creating smoother transitions.  
- **"Tension" Feature**  
  - Provides control over the tangent direction derivative along surface edges, similar to features in lofting or bridging workflows.  
  - Allows alternation or amplification of surface shapes by adjusting the magnitude of tangency, giving users more creative control over surface continuity. For more information on this feature, click [here](/solid/square) for Square Command or [here](/solid/xnurb) for XNurbs Command.

### CV Move Editing 
- **Proportional and Mirrored Transformations**  
  - Users can now edit surface CVs proportionally and with mirrored transformations. For more information, click [here](/common/move#move-control-point).

### Raise Degree Command Enhancement
- The **Raise Degree** command can now be executed when a surface CV is selected, simplifying degree adjustments during modeling.  

### Toggle Points Command Update  
- The **Toggle Points** command is now accessible when a curve CV is selected, improving workflow consistency between curve and surface editing.  

## 3. Sketching and Curve Tools

### Curve Rebuild Enhancement  
- **Deviation Plot**  
  - The Curve Rebuild tool now offers a Deviation Plot, giving users a clear way to track changes during the rebuild process, helping ensure more accurate results.  

### Snapping Enhancements  
- **New Tangent Snapping**  
  - Introducing **Tan/Tan** snapping for ellipses and general splines, improving precision when aligning curves. 

### Sketching Enhancements
- **Region Deletion Behavior**  
  - Deleting regions now automatically removes the curves that bound them, making manual cleanup easier and faster.  

## 4. Transformation Tools

### Transform Command Enhancements
- **Stored Transform Pivots**  
  - Transformation pivots are now saved with bodies, making move commands more consistent and intuitive.  
- **Customizable Transform Options**  
  - Users can specify the transform orientation (**Local**, **CPlane**, **World**) and pivot point (**Bounding Box**, **Median**, **Last Selected**), offering greater flexibility in transformations.

## 5. Surface Tools

### Sheet Extension Enhancements
- Introduced a new 'Natural' mode for extending sheets along natural or isoparametric edges.
- Surface extension modes can now be toggled using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key.  

### Construction Plane Enhancements 
- **Dynamic Plane Creation**  
  - Users can now create a construction plane that passes through two selected points and aligns with the camera view.
  - Ideal for planarizing a hull while maintaining alignment with the view direction, making the process faster and more intuitive. 

### Trimming Optimization  
- Trimming operations for densely packed 2D sketches, such as hex grids, are now significantly faster and more efficient.  

## 6. Selection and Conversion

### Selection Conversion Enhancements
- **New Conversion Options**  
  - Vertices or CVs can now be converted to points and vice versa.  
  - Regions can be converted to their bounding curves for better usability.  

## 7. User Interface

### New User Interface Design 
- Revamped with a modern and streamlined appearance while retaining functional aspects from earlier versions.
- Improved feature placement and enhanced usability to optimize workflows.
- This update lays the groundwork for future UI enhancements.
