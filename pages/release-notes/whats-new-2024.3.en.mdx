# Plasticity 24.3 Release Notes  

Plasticity 24.3 introduces a wide array of enhancements and new features aimed at improving surface modeling workflows, enhancing usability, and streamlining the user experience. Below is a detailed overview of the updates:  

---

## **1. Square Command Updates**  
- **New "Free" Option**  
  - Allows trading G0 precision for a higher-quality surface finish.  
- **Improved Functionality**  
  - The command now supports selecting one or more faces to act as a rough `RefitTrim` or `TrimConvert` tool.  
  - It can also be executed without any preselected geometry, enhancing flexibility in various workflows.  

---

## **2. Xnurbs/Square Enhancements**  
- **"Adjacent" Boundary Option**  
  - Introduces a new boundary condition that uses adjacent trimmed edges for smoother transitions.  
- **"Tension" Feature**  
  - Provides control over the tangent direction derivative along surface edges, similar to features in lofting or bridging workflows.  
  - Allows alternation or amplification of surface shapes by adjusting the magnitude of tangency, giving users more creative control over surface continuity.  

---

## **3. New Slide Command**  
- **CV Sliding**  
  - Enables users to move displayed control vertices (CVs) along the surface hull.  
  - Movement is guided by the CVâ€™s respective direction, allowing manual fine-tuning of surface topology.  
  - This feature significantly expands precision modeling capabilities for surface refinement.  

---

## **4. CV Move Editing**  
- **Proportional and Mirrored Transformations**  
  - Users can now edit surface CVs proportionally and with mirrored transformations, bringing the editing workflow closer to Sub-D modeling techniques.  

---

## **5. Raise Degree Command Enhancements**  
- The `Raise Degree` command can now be executed when a surface CV is selected, simplifying degree adjustments during modeling.  

---

## **6. Toggle Points Improvements**  
- The `Toggle Points` command is now accessible when a curve CV is selected, improving workflow consistency between curve and surface editing.  

---

## **7. Construction Plane Enhancements**  
- **Dynamic Plane Creation**  
  - Allows users to create a construction plane passing through two selected points and aligning parallel to the camera view.  
  - Ideal for planarizing a hull while maintaining alignment with the view direction, making the process faster and more intuitive.  

---

## **8. Curve Rebuild Enhancements**  
- **Deviation Plot**  
  - The curve rebuild tool now includes a deviation plot for precise control, enabling users to assess changes during the rebuild process.  

---

## **9. Transform Commands (Move, Rotate, Scale)**  
- **Stored Transform Pivots**  
  - Transformation pivots are now saved with bodies, making subsequent move commands more consistent and intuitive.  
- **Customizable Transform Options**  
  - Users can specify the transform orientation (`Local`, `CPlane`, `World`) and pivot point (`Bounding Box`, `Median`, `Last Selected`), offering greater flexibility in transformations.  

---

## **10. Trimming Optimization**  
- **Performance Improvements**  
  - Trimming operations for densely packed 2D sketches, such as hex grids, are now significantly faster and more efficient.  

---

## **11. Snapping Enhancements**  
- **New Tangent Snapping**  
  - Adds `Tan/Tan` snapping for ellipses and general splines, enhancing precision when aligning curves.  

---

## **12. Selection Conversion Enhancements**  
- **New Conversion Options**  
  - Users can now convert vertices or CVs to points and vice versa.  
  - Regions can also be converted to their bounding curves for easier downstream use.  

---

## **13. Sketching Enhancements**  
- **Region Deletion Behavior**  
  - Deleting regions now automatically removes the curves that bound them, reducing manual cleanup.  

---

## **14. Sheet Extension Enhancements**  
- **New "Natural" Mode**  
  - Adds a mode for extending sheets along natural or isoparametric edges.  
- **Improved Workflow**  
  - Surface extension modes can now be toggled using the `Tab` key, making the process more intuitive.  

---

## **15. New User Interface Design**  
- **Revamped UI**  
  - The updated interface retains functional elements from previous versions while introducing a cleaner and more modern design.  
  - Features improved feature placement and visual consistency, enhancing overall usability.  
- **Future Improvements**  
  - This marks the beginning of further refinements to establish a strong, efficient workspace tailored to users' needs.
