## Join Curves

You can join Curves at connecting points.

2. Press <kbd>J</kbd>.
3. Curves are joined.

<Callout emoji="❗">
**Attention**<br />
To join two Curves, their endpoints must be perfectly aligned.
When they are perfectly aligned, the Points will turn green. If they appear purple, they are not aligned.
To ensure a precise alignment of the two Points, make sure [**Object Snaps**](../3d-viewport/grid-and-snap#object-snap) are enabled, then hold down <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and drag to snap to the other point.
