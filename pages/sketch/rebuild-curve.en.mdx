# Rebuild Curve [#rebuild-curve]

<Reference shortcut="" command="Rebuild Curve" button="In Suggested Commands Menu" buttonIcon='button-rebuild'/>

Rebuild by optimizing the positions of the Control Vertices(CVs) without changing the shape of the Curve.

## Basic Usage

1. Select the  Curve you want to rebuild.
2. Click the button <ButtonIcon type="button-rebuild" />
3. Set the options in the Command Dialog.
  - <Kst>Command Dialog</Kst>
    - **Method:**
      - **Refit:** Rebuild within tolerances.
        - **Tolerance:** Specify the Tolerances.
        - **Keep corners:** When enabled, the corners of the Curve are not changed.
      - **Points** Rebuild within the specified number of CVs.
        - **Points:** Specify the number of CVs.
      - **Explicit Control:** Rebuild within the specified number of degree and spans. *(Available on Indie and Studio License)*
        - **Degree & Spans:** Specify the value of degree and number of spans.
        - **Weight:** Based on the specified *Degree and Spans* settings, you can adjust the **Weight** to control the position of CVs. A lower value loosens the curve's shape, improving quality for surface workflows. A higher value keeps the curve closer to its original shape, preserving accuracy and structure. (Default: **0.5**)
4. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.
