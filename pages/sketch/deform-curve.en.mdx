**Tip** 
Sometimes, using a reference face can lead to unwanted deformations and inaccurate placement on the target surface. To avoid this, select the face of the target object, open the Command Palette and type **Unwrap Face** command. This generates a new reference face from the object, allowing you to apply the deform command with better accuracy.
