# Bridge Curve[#bridge-curve]

<Reference shortcut="" command="Bridge Curve" button="Toolbar" buttonIcon='button-bridge-curve' />

Bridges two Curves that can be G0/G1/G2/G3 continuous. Tension is adjustable. Auto trim is possible. Measure Curvature is available.

## Basic Usage

<Callout emoji="❗">
    **Note**<br />
Before selecting a point, enable [**Grid Snaps**](/plasticity-essentials/grid-and-units) and [**Object Snaps**](/plasticity-essentials/snap#object-snap).
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
The starting and ending points can be selected at any point on the  Curve, Edge,Face, or construction plane.

          - **Parameter:**
               - **Value 1/2:** The relative position on the segment of the starting point/ending point.
          - **Sense:** 
               - **Sense 1/2:** Reverse the direction of the starting point/ending point.
          - **Tension 1:**
               - **Value 1/2:** The tension value affected 1st Control-Vertex(CV) to 3rd CV of the starting point/ending point.
          - **Tension 2:**
               - **Value 1/2:** The tension value affected 2nd CV and 3rd CV of the starting point/ending point.
          - **Tension 3:**
               - **Value 1/2:** The tension value affected 3rd CV of the starting point/ending point.
          - **Start curvature:**
               - **G0, G1, G2, G3:** Specify the [continuity of the  Curve](/cad-essentials/continuity-curve-and-surface) at the starting point.
          -  **End curvature:**
               - **G0, G1, G2, G3:** Specify the [continuity of the  Curve](/cad-essentials/continuity-curve-and-surface) at the ending point.      
          - **Trim:** When turned on, any Curve that extends beyond the bridge will be trimmed.
          - **Analysis:** Adjust the size of the curvature comb when the menu is open. Learn more about [Measure Curvature](/sketch/measure-curvature).
5. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.
