# Extend Curve

<Reference shortcut="" command="Extend Curve" button="" />

Extend a Curve by specifying the distance. Choose from extension shapes like Natural, Linear, Soft, Reflective, and Arc.

## Basic Usage

1. Select the end Point of the Curve you wish to extend.
2. Use the **Extend** command in the Command Palette.
3. Press <kbd>D</kbd>, move the cursor, and click at the endpoint.
4. Set the options in the Command Dialog.
   - <Kst>Command Dialog</Kst>
      - **Shape:** Specify the shape of the extended curve. Options **Natural**, **Linear**, **Soft**, **Reflective**, and **Arc** will directly influence the shape and curvature of the extended curve during extrusion.
            - **Natural:** Extends the curve "naturally" by continuing the curve described by the original curve just before the start of the extension.
            - **Linear:** Extends the curve in a flat, straight line from the boundary point, maintaining the current tangent direction without altering curvature.
            - **Soft:** Gradually blends the extension with the existing curve for a smooth transition, preserving both tangent and curvature.
            - **Reflective:** Mirrors the curvature and tangency of the curve for a symmetrical and seamless continuation, ideal for maintaining curve symmetry.
            - **Arc:** Extends the curve in a circular arc from the boundary point.

      - **Distance:** Specify the distance.
5. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.
